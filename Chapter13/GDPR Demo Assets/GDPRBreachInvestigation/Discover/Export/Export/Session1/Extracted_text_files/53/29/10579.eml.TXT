Tracy,
 
We have several cost centers in Tax that wish to allocate to Clean Fuels.  How do you want us to handle these assuming that they should not go to EOTT?

Dawn:  Only assets were sold to EOTT.  The legal entities still remain with Enron.  The $30,000 cost represents clean fuel companies and Methnol.

Greek, 

Our understanding is that Clean Fuels has been sold to EOTT and so I included the Clean Fuels allocation in with EOTT's number.

Dawn:  Laura Mattox of EOTT called inquiring about her tax charge(CC14502) of $79,000 which is 3 times more than last year.  My records show a charge of $49,000 to EOTT.  Can you help me explain the $30,000 difference?

Thanks, 
Greek
