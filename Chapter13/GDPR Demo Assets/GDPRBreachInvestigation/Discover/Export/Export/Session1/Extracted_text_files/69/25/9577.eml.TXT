Scott Hendrickson might be the trader on the other deal, depending on the 
pipeline, but he is not aware of it. 
 Do you know the pipeline for this deal?

Jerolyn at IMD requested a confirm for 
June Delivery @ TX Eastern for 14,745MMBtu/per day, traded on 05/25/00 (Their 
trader is David Stratton).
June Delivery @ Citygate for 10,000MMBtu/per day, traded on 05/24/00 (Their 
trader is Jonathon Holfman)

I cannot find these deals in Sitara or TAGG and have no deal numbers to 
reference.

Please advise
Thanks
Jennifer
