Sale of Enron's EDI IP to ECOutlook
Last week Enron sold to ECOutlook it's intellectual property related to it's current EDI Hub for $3,000,000 and a 5 year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of ECOutlook stock at $2.25 per share.  Enron through a separate investment in ECOutlook in 2000 currently owns 6% of the company.  Once Enron executes the warrant we would own a total of 7% of the company.  ECOutlook's current customer list includes Bausch & Lomb, Bristol-Meyers, Ciba-Vision, BASF, Dupont, Equistar/Lyondell, Perseco(McDonalds), Sun Microsystems, SYSCO, Pentacon and others.  

Enron's EDI Hub currently processes the following types of transactions:

Products     Internal C/P's	External	    Documents
Gas	5	69	Nominations	Schedule Quantities	
			Quick Response	Capacity	
				Meter Statements	
				Imbalance	
					
					
Electric	4	20	Enrollments	Meter Info	
			Terminations	Usage	
			Switch Notice	Payments	
			Rate Confirmation		
			Invoices		
			Billing		
			Purchase Order		
					
Financial	8	20	Checks	Acknowledgements	
			Direct Deposits	Utility Invoices	
			Advices	Consolidated Billing	
			Issuances		
			Financial Report		
			Wire Transfers		
The existing IP related to these types of transactions is now owned by ECPower and they will have the right to market it to other customers.  

Enron has also entered into a five-year O&M agreement and will transition the operations of it's EDI Hub from ECPower to ECOutlook over the next six-months.  The O&M rates are flat to our deal with ECPower.  

Enron also paid $100,000 to purchase a license to ECOutlook's B2B connectivity software called SDI Server.  We are looking at ways to use this software to assist data transformation efforts between EIM, EGM and their trading partners. 

Attached are the Asset Purchase, EDI O&M and EDI License Agreements for your review.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  -  Tommy
