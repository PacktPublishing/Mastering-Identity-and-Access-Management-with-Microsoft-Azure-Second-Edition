Hi Tracy - Understand there may be a glitch in the spreadsheet.  Let me know. 

Can I still get yearend estimates on IBIT and NI for the EGS groups.  Also, Rod mentioned you might know 2000 bonus payouts for PGE & what they may have accrued for this year.  Any assistance would be appreciated - am having difficulty getting PGE #'s.  

Thanks much./JD

	BVP payout - $10.94 (Estimated ETS funding plus estimated credit from Joint Venture)
