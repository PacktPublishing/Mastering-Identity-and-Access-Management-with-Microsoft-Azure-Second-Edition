Subject: NNG & TW 2001 Third Current Estimate - Earning Models

Tracy,

       Attached are the two Earnings Models for each company which complement the Cash Flow Models I sent to both you and Kevin a few minutes ago. Call me if you have anything else. If I'm not at my deck I can only hope phone mail will be working again.

                                                                                                                    Steve
