Subject: BUSINESS REVIEWS IN EUROPE END OF 1ST QUARTER, 2002

Good morning, Tracy!   

Stan wants us to look at the week of May 6, 2002, to travel to Europe and meet with Colin's team(s) and Adam's team(s).   See if we can hit all the necessary sites within that one week time span.

I'll await to hear back from you.

Thanks!
