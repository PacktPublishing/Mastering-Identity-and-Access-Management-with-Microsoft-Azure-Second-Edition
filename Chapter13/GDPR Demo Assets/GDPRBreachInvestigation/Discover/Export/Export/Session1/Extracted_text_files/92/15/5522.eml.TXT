Attached is a spreadsheet which depicts the Trailblazer revenues for years 2002-2003.  The $6.6 million revenue level for 2002  compares to the following:

Year 2001 Plan :                      $3.7 Million
2nd CE:                                  $4.9  Million (includes a $1 million upside booked in 1st quarter due to an imbalance cashout)
Year 2002 Plan (last year):       $4.8 million


If you have any questions or need additional information, please let me know.
