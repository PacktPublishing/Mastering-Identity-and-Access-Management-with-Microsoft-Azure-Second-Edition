Rod, 
   I have made contact with Steve Gilbert and Stephanie Korbelik this morning. Annual volumes/average rates (vs. monthly) have been request from them. Steph will e-mail schedules ASAP to both of us. Let me know if more data is needed and if I need to hand carry to Kevin.
                                                                                                                 Steve

Do you have volumes and rates info to go with the NNG current estimate and the 2002 plan?    If not you, can you get for me?

I am not aware of the volume/rate info you used - is this pulled in from another schedule?


Kevin,

Do you have the volume and rate information on Northern Natural that will
tie to Rod's forecast as well?

Kyle
