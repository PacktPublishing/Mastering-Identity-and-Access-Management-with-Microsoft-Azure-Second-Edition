Tracy, 

We still have not had a response from you on the roles assigned below.  Please let me know if we should be contacting someone else or if this is no longer your responsibility.  Our security audit has begun and the auditors are requesting documentation on the signoff from the business units.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thank you!
Danette
