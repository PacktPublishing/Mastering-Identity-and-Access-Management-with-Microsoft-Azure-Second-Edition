Tracy,
Do you want all corp request to come thru to you?  We get many requests that are not earnings related from Corp Development, RAC, investors relations, etc.?  I can also just copy you on schedules that I'm sending out.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Thank you.  Stan and Rod are looking to me to coordinate all these new companies we picked up.  Its easier to track if it all comes through one place.

Okay.

I didn't send Mark anything new as the number I gave him came from our 2nd CE with adjustments for the things transferred in and out of EGAS.  

Agatha and I will coordinate with you in the future.

Please make sure your numbers go through me or Stan before we give them to Corp. Corp's request for these things should be coming through me in the future.   Rod and I are meeting with Stan on Monday, October 22.  We would like to discuss your 4th Q numbers then if possible.

Let me know.

Thanks

Tracy

Mark,

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.
