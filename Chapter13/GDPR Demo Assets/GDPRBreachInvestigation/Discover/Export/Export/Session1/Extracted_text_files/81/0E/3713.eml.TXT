David,

I was reviewing the 7 page summary of the longer term muni bonds that I
recently bought.
This summary is very helpful.  I would appreciate it if you could also
provide me with the following:
1)a summary of the short term municpal bonds I bought about a month ago and
2) a combined summary of all the municipal bonds I recently purchased.

Please call me should you have any questions at 713 853 4723 or 713 503
3466.


Thank you,


Scott Neal
