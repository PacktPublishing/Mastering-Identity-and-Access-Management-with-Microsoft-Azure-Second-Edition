Here are the filters for Sitara Position manager for NE and SE pipes.  Get 
out of Position managers, launch the appropriate filters below.  When you 
re-open Sitara Position mgr, look under Open on the menu bar and the 2 
filters should be there. Hit ok and the filter should apply to your position 
mgr.  THANKS

Here are some new NE and SE pipe filters.
Remember that you must be out of Position Manager when you launch the 
attachments.

Thanks
