Subject: FW: Gas Logistics 2001 C.E. vs 2002 Plan

FYI...the 2002 budget for Communications (111721) is in Gas Logistics in Adaytum.  
Please let me know if you need it moved.
Thanks,
Nancy

We need to let Tracy and James know that so they can move it where ever it belongs.   cvb

No...We included it in Adaytum because we weren't sure where it would go, and wanted to be sure the costs were included in the Plan.

Communications for 2002 is moving out of Gas Logistics into somewhere else.  Did we remove it from Gas Logistics?   cvb

James,

I believe the Communications for 2002 should be $.2MM in NNG's Gas Logistics...
Anyway...

NNG 2002 increase is due primarily to:
	EPSC			$.3
	Less Capitalized	$.4
	Increase in Benefits	$.15
	Increase in Salaries	$.1
Hope this helps.
Nancy
