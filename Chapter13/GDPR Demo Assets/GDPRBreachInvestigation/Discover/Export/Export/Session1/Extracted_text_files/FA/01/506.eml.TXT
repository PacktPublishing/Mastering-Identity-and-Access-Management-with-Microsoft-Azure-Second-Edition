Jerry suggested a breakfast meeting the morning of October 12.  Will you be back in Houston in time for the Plan Review with Mr. Horton at 8:30 that morning?  Please see Kathy's note below suggesting a meeting prior to the Plan Review.

Thanks, Tracy.

Rod and Tracy:

Would you be able to meet with Jerry before the Budget Meeting with Mr. Horton?  Jerry said that a breakfast meeting would work for him.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  FYI, Jerry will be staying at the Doubletree Hotel the night before (Oct. 11).

Rod and Tracy:

Jerry Peters would like to meet with you on Thursday, October 11, upon his arrival in Houston.  Jerry is scheduled to land in Houston at 2:39 pm, so he suggested scheduling a meeting at 4:00 p.m.  Topic of discussion is Northern Border SAP Charges for 2001.

Please let me know if you would be available to meet with Jerry at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, October 11.

Thank you.

Dee
