To all,

I would like to propose a meeting to discuss company development and implementation of a strategy to place the Bahamian LNG.

The time will be 4 pm on Thursday May 31.

Kim will respond with the location.  I would prefer each of you attend so if this doesn't fit schedules, let me know.

Regards,

Jared
