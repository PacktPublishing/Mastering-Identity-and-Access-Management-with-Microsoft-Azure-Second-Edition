Attached, please find an updated allocations schedule which now reflects in a separate line the planned IT Infrastructure Allocation related to each support department that will be passed on to each Business Unit from ENA for 2002.

 << File: EA Allocations to Other BUs-10.22.01.xls >> 
Also attached is related support:
 << File: Infrastructure Allocation BU's 10_22_01.xls >> 
Thanks,
Edie
