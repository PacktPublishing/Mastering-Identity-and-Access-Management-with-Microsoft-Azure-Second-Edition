Subject: 2002 Benefit Rates and Analyst/Associate Charges

Below is the file containing Flex Dollar amounts and the Benefit Rates to be used in preparing your Business Unit's 2002 Plan.  I have also included the flat rates for the Analyst and Associate Program. 

Beginning in June 2001, the Analyst and Associate Program began billing the flat fees to GL account - 52503000 Allocations Other.  A new GL account - 52502600  Analyst & Associate Allocations will be set up and should be used to plan for next year.  PLEASE NOTE:  If you have any reports, cost element groups or spreadsheets that use a listing of GL accounts, you will need to update them to include the new account.


 


Associate		$10,400
3rd Yr. Analyst		  $7,400
Analyst			  $6,400
Tax Analyst		  $2,400
Summer Analyst	  $3,300
Summer Associates	  $6,000

Please fee free to call me if you have any questions.
