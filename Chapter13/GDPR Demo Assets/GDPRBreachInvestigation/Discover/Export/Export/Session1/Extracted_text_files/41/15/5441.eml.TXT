I thought they only supported the six Houston people.

I know for a fact, that the California is self contained.  I believe that Europe is the same way.

Does networks really support all of these people?  If assets are sold, I assume support would go away?

Thanks

Tracy

Tracy,

The file we received from Corporate listed an estimated 461 domestic employees and 526 international (987 total) for the 2002 plan.  This information came from the Corporate headcount request to the BU's that was due on 6/22.  Currently there's a group of 937 (451 domestic, 486 international) that is being supported.  I'll call you tomorrow to see why there's such a large discrepancy between this headcount and the 6 you're projecting.

Listed below are services the Infrastructure group provides to EREC:

IT Security, Policy, Monitoring, and Investigation
Software License Management
Terminal Server Operations
DMZ Security
24x7 Support

passthrough services:
Calling Card
Video Conferencing
Remote Access

Allison

This is going to happen.  Besides, there are only 6 people in HOuston, we can't be talking alot of dollars here.

Mike, is this a FOR SURE thing?  What about timing?  Of the announcement as well as closing?  If we build our allocations on things that may happen, we will be changing it daily.  I think we must assume status quo until it's final.

Allison,
Just spoke with Tracy.  The plan for EREC is to sell approx 85% of the equity to a 3rd party in 2001.  Once sale is complete, the EREC Houston personnel will not be relying on Infrastructure services.  Please communicate this to the appropriate Infrastructure assessment groups.  I'd like to have ready before the final BU assessments go out this week.  
Thanks,
Mike
