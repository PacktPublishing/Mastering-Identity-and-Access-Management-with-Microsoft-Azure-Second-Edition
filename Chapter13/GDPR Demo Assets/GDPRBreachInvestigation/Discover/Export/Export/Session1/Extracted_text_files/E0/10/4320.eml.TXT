Subject: EPA Request

Recently, Enron Corp received a request from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide information relating to any spill, discharge, or release of "oil" (broadly defined but excludes natural gas or liquid petroleum gas) from any EOTT pipeline facility for the time period from July 1, 1998 to July 7, 2001. A "pipeline facility" includes those fleet operations where tanks are connected by/to pipelines or to other tanks through piping and in which any EOTT entity owns an interest. The EPA request seeks detailed information concerning releases of "oil" during this period, including among other things, the extent and nature of the spill, which EOTT or EPSC representative/employee was the first to learn of the spill, remedial efforts, weather conditions at the release site, etc. The request also seeks information concerning pipeline management system(s) in place during this three-year period and efforts or investments made by EOTT to prevent the release of "oil," including capital costs, expenditures and maintenance costs. 

In order to respond to the EPA information request, you are instructed to identify and locate any relevant documents or information and ensure that no responsive information or documents are destroyed or discarded. You may be contacted about this inquiry in the near future, because we will be sending teams to many of the field locations to assist employees in identifying and locating documents responsive to the EPA's information request. If you believe you have relevant information or responsive documents but have not been contacted/visited by one of our teams by August 17, 2001, please contact the designated document custodian, Don Hawkins (713-646-7358).

Due to the length of the EPA information request, we have not attached the document here. However, if you would like a copy, have any questions concerning the scope or nature of the request, or have any questions regarding the document collection process, please contact Lou Soldano (713-853-7237) or Dave Nutt (713-853-7267). 

Thank you for your cooperation.

Phil
