Michael works for John and we have reviewed the 3rd CE with both.  I can forward to you, I am curious as to what the report is that you are preparing?

Thanks

Tracy

Tracy,
Can you send me whatever you got from Kenny/Michael for Azurix 3rd Current Estimate?  I have a report due to John Garrison that asks for that information.

Thanks,

Paula
