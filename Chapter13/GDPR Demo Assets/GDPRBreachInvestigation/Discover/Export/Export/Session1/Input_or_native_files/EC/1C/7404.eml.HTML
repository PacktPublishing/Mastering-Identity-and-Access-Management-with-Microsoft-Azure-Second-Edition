<br>
<br>Phil Gas Works has asked me several times to ome uop and visit them when I 
<br>get a chance especially to talk about their winter RFP they are putting 
<br>together. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also Maureen and I were hoping to plan a trip togeher to see 
<br>PSE&amp;G, but now Maureen is going to have to postpoone for a while
<br>
<br>I was looking at the calendar and it looks like the 19 and 20th would be good 
<br>days. &nbsp;Does this sound okay with you? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks.
