<br>
<br>Could we have a telephone call and discuss what our slides should look like for this presentation. &nbsp;I assume we will try to make the presentation for the respective pipelines look similar - &nbsp;as much as possible. &nbsp;Let me know when you are available. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have time today from 1:00 to 2:00 and about 4:30. &nbsp;Tomorrow I am free most of the day. [Geaccone, Tracy] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am working with Rod on this one. &nbsp;LEts try Thursday afternoon? 
<br>
<br>
<br>I also would like to know if our timeline has changed &nbsp;-( 9/22 with Stan and 11/8 with Mr. Lay) [Geaccone, Tracy] &nbsp;Do you mean 10/22. &nbsp;I will put something out on this this afternoon. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Lastly, is there an expectation for the Quarter Forecast? &nbsp;Right now, NNG Commercial is showing a September upside as well as an October upside. &nbsp;We plan to offset all but $500,000 in the November / December time frame. &nbsp;&nbsp;While we would be up for the period from Sept-Dec by the $500,000, we would be down for the fourth quarter. [Geaccone, Tracy] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sure you are ready to commit to this. &nbsp;Can you make it up? 
<br>
<br>Thanks
