I won't guarantee I can make it, but I will try. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some thoughts, as we move forward with this deal:
<br>
<br>Levelized rates - will require separate rate base, not rolled in, since the base system is not levelized and separate tariff schedules like a FTS-2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also we need to see what the GAAP income statments will look like and what the return on equity will really look like if we do this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may surprise some of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also think we need to make sure Stan is OK with the potential result if we are going to offer it.

<br> Attached is the open season and binding bid package for the Sun Devil Pipeline Project. &nbsp;We will meet in Steve Harris' office on Thurs 8/2 at 10:30am to get a consensous on the pitch strategy. &nbsp;We should also have a good idea on rates as well. &nbsp;I hope you can join us. &nbsp;If not, please get with me later in the day with any questions or concerns. &nbsp;Our goal is to release this to the media for publication Friday 8/3.
