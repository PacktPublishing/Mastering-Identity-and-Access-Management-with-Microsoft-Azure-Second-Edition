Hughes is a real piece of work.    I thought you should be aware of this.

I think I have this covered.    The issue is with Corp. planning and their =
requests, not the other Corp groups and Tracy and I have taken care of that=
.    Jeff didn't take it the way Jim has, in fact he welcomed the idea.    =
Jeff has told me that dealing with Jim might be an "experience".    Maybe y=
ou should ask Jim to raise the issue with me, or alternatively just let him=
 know that you would like to be aware of the numbers before they go to Corp=
, which is all Tracy asked for.     Do you see "the tone of the message is =
demeaning" in Tracy's message?    Just curious.

I would like to discuss the below message when you have a chance.  There ha=
s been a lot of distrust and concern over "managed information" with respec=
t to the international assets.  My team has overcome this by going out of o=
ur way to cooperate and be transparent with corp the last year and a half. =
 I am uncomfortable asking my people not to respond to corp requests for in=
formation.  I also think the tone of the message is demeaning and could hav=
e a morale impact on my folks.

Mark,=20

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2n=
d CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferre=
d out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Me=
rchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This=
 does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe=
 to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will =
send you those numbers when we are done.
