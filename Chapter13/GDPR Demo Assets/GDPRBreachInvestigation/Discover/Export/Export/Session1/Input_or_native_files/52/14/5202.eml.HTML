Tracy,
<br>
<br>Attached is the file you requested. &nbsp;I have made substantial assumptions regarding the requested content, and the content provided may not be what was intended to be requested.
<br>
<br>Please note the following:
<br>
<br>- The EREC earnings figures are from the Hyperion system as of Oct. 19th
<br>- The 2001-02 Expenses are from the 3CE and 2002 Plan respectively. &nbsp;The cost-type breakdown requested is not available.
<br>- The cash burn rate is net and ties to the change in the Enron Working Capital line balance by period. I do not have visibility to the gross outflows due to format differences.
<br>
<br>Please call with any questions.
<br>
<br>Thanks.
<br>
<br>Chris

<br>Please see the three tabs for EGS and complete for your business unit. &nbsp;I will need this back to me by 2:00 today so I can consolidate and give to Corp by 3:00. &nbsp;The numbers should be the ones consolidated to Enron only.
<br>
<br>Jim and Bob, can you complete the EGS IS tab for me for ETS and EOTT.
<br>
<br>Thanks
<br>

<br>
<br>Hello everyone. &nbsp;I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately. &nbsp;That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information. &nbsp;Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets. &nbsp;Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions). &nbsp;&nbsp;The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15. &nbsp;Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished. &nbsp;If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Steve
