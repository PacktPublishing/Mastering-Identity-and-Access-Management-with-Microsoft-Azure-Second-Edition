The O & M/G & A graph needs to be done in two graphs.  One for direct costs=
 and one for Corporate costs.  This way you can better see the increase in =
the Corp costs. =20

Thanks

 << File: Template.ppt >>=20
Company name should be replaced by your business unit name.
EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your busine=
ss unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc.  This works 	better if you do this in t=
he View, Master, Slide Master area.
The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corpor=
ate costs and other significant allocated costs.
  	Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that hav=
e increased significantly.
Please use the Arial font.
It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.

We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only s=
how 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.  If that does not tell the story you are t=
rying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on =
Nov. 1.

I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.  Howev=
er, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at
9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible.  I will need to ma=
ke books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.

On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.

If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-85=
3-7372.=20
