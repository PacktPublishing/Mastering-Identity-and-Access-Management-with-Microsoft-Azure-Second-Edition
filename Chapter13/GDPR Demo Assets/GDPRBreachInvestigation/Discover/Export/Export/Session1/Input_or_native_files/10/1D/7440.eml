 Sheet 2 of the attachment provides an analysis of intercompany billings (2=
001 Forecast and 2002 Plan).  Sheet 3 shows what services the allocation co=
vers (i.e., MAD and PEP).  Call me if you have questions.

ave attached our latest information including the two page template for you=
r OOC presentation with Louise and the allocations worksheet as well.  Plea=
se let me know if you would like to discuss.  I know that your meeting is s=
cheduled for Friday.

Edie,

The ETS numbers ($199,060) don't seem to agree with the detail sheet ($195,=
323)?

Thanks,

Robert

Attached is the ENA Allocations Schedule with Revised HR numbers.  In addit=
ion, I have once again included a separate file with further support schedu=
les for the various Support Departments.  Please note that the most efficie=
nt way to resolve any disagreement with any of the allocations is to contac=
t the Support Department contact directly.  I have included those persons' =
names on the 2002 Schedule.  I will be happy to assist in answering any que=
stions that I can, but am unable to revise the allocations without a reques=
t from that person.

All alloctions will be made based on actuals during 2002.  Actuals will eit=
her be assessed on a monthly basis or potentially trued up on a quarterly b=
asis.

Please be advised that our HR group has requested a subsequent change and t=
his will once again result in a revision of the HR allocations.

Thanks,

Attached please find an updated Allocations schedule from ENA for 2002 Plan=
.  Please note that the considerable increase in many of the allocations is=
 caused by the decision to include an allocation of bonuses for each suppor=
t department.  These bonus numbers are based on historical data and are cal=
culated at a high level.  Bonuses were not allocated in the prior year and =
therefore will cause a considerable variance year on year.

Please contact me with any questions you may have or additional information=
 you may need so that we can resolve any issues in an efficient manner.  Af=
ter resolution of questions, please provide me your final agreement on thes=
e numbers via e:mail.

Thanks,
Edie
