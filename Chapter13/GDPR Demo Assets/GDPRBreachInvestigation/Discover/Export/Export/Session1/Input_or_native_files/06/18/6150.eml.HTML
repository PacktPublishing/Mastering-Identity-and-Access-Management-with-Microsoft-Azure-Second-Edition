<br>Executive Impact &amp; Influence Program
<br>
<br>Dear Scott Neal,
<br>
<br>As part of the Executive Impact and Influence Program,
<br>each participant is asked to gather input on the
<br>participant's own management styles and practices as
<br>experienced by their immediate manager, each direct
<br>report, and up to eight colleagues/peers.
<br>
<br>You have been requested to provide feedback for a
<br>participant attending the next program. &nbsp;Your input
<br>(i.e., a Self assessment, if you are a participant in
<br>this program, Manager assessment, Direct Report
<br>assessment, or Colleague/Peer assessment) will be
<br>combined with the input of others and used by the
<br>program participant to develop an action plan to
<br>improve his/her management styles and practices. &nbsp;If
<br>you are providing feedback as a Manager of the
<br>participant, please note that your feedback will be
<br>identified in the summary report.
<br>
<br>It is important that you complete this assessment NO
<br>LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS on Tuesday, May 1, 2001.
<br>
<br>To begin the online administration process, you will
<br>need the following Internet address and Password(s).
<br>NOTE: &nbsp;If you are providing feedback for more than one
<br>person, each password and participant name is
<br>individually listed below.
<br>
<br>Open your Internet browser e.g., Internet Explorer or
<br>Netscape Navigator, and please type or copy the URL
