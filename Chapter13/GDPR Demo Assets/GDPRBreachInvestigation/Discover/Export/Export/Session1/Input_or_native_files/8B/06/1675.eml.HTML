I received these comments this afternoon from JPMorgan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to have some help putting together a story to counteract the basics of this story from CERA.

<br>Subject: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California
<br>Importance: High
<br>
<br>
<br>Rod:
<br>
<br>As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.
<br>
<br>Overall demand picture
<br>
<br>Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2002 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2003 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demand will be flat
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2004 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;growth in demand will begin
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2005-2006 &nbsp;&nbsp;return to 2001 demand levels
<br>
<br>Reasoning:
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas
<br>
<br>Gas transmission capacity into the state
<br>
<br>Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;800 mmcf/d in 2002
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;300 mmcf/d &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)
<br>
<br>San Juan basin gas
<br>
<br>San Juan basin production is declining
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing
<br>
<br>
<br>The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.
<br>
<br>However, the &quot;wild card&quot; in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.
<br>
<br>As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.
<br>
<br>Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.
<br>
<br>Thanks Rod
<br>
<br>Brent
<br>
<br>Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
<br>e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks
<br>
