yes, I have seen the fertilizer companies back off their buying due to gas=

prices.    Terra Resources reduced their purchasing signficantly for the=20
month of June, supposedly they bought no spot gas at all only term=20
commitments.   There total load is around 200,000 but I do not know the mix=

up between spot and term.   Also CF Industries and Farmland (which are smal=

gas buyers) reduced their volumes as well.    PCS initially reduced their=20
voumes for thier Geismer facility but when gas prices dipped to upper 3.90s=

and low 4.00's they came in and bought the supples they had curtailed and a=

at max volumes.


Thanks.
