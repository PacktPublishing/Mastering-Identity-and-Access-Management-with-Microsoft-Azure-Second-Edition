Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external cand=
idates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two=
 traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes hav=
e already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders). =20

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few =
days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there i=
s no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the e=
vening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach =
your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday =
pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.
