<br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Segments
<br>
<br>As you know we are looking into new segments for Enron's reporting. Part of this exercise will be to look at adding to our disclosure in order to satisfy the 
<br>investment community and help them better understand Enron's business. One of the possible items of disclosure is net income on a segment basis. This 
<br>would involve the allocation of debt and therefore interest to the segments similar to what we do for ROE and capital charge calculations. Because this 
<br>could be reported we are taking a harder look at these allocations as we will need to be able to defend externally. 
<br>
<br>Although we will not be segmenting based on business units I would like to look at capital structures at the business unit level. This of course will be aggregated 
<br>up to the appropriate segment as they are determined. I am currently focusing on an estimated 12/31/2001 balance sheet for allocation purposes. This is our best 
<br>guess at what would report at year end. We are using the 7/31/2001 actual balance sheet as a starting point and rolling based on the 2nd current estimate turned in
<br>by the business units and adding in any estimated transactions to occur &nbsp;between now and year end.
<br>
<br>I would like to set up meetings with each business unit to discuss their theoretical capital structure and get your ideas sometime EARLY the week of Sept 17.
<br>We will try to make a first pass based on each business units ability to service debt and reasonable credit ratios based on comparables. Please take time 
<br>to think about this and give me a call to arrange a time to meet. Thanks.
