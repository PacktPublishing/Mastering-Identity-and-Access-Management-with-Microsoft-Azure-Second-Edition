<br>&gt; Hi Scott, my name is Travis Wolf of Wolf Real &nbsp;Estate. &nbsp;I wanted to
<br>&gt; let you know of a ranch I just listed for &nbsp;sale.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; The ranch is 1529 acres 45 min. southeast of San &nbsp;Antonio.
<br>&gt; 8 miles from Stockdale,tx. &nbsp;it has 2 miels of &nbsp;paved road frontage on
<br>&gt; hwy 119. &nbsp;heavily wooded hunting ranch with large &nbsp;blackjack oaks.
<br>&gt; game high fence on the back line. &nbsp;the land has 6 &nbsp;ponds. &nbsp;2 of which
<br>&gt; are around 3 acres plus in size. &nbsp;the land is &nbsp;listed at $950 per
<br>&gt; acre.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; if your still in the market for a great hunting &nbsp;ranch or a great
<br>&gt; investment property contact me for more info
