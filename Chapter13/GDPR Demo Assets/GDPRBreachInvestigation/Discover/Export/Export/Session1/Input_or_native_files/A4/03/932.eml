After the capital charge was recorded in CS in March, an error was found in=
 the calculation.  For most business units, this results in only a small ad=
justment.  We plan to make the necessary correction and send the revised fi=
le to everyone.  After it has been reviewed, we will book the capital charg=
e for Jan - April in FI in May business.  We will then book May's capital c=
harge in FI in June.  We have not yet resolved the timing on booking June. =
 Since the balance sheet and cash flow continue to change after the income =
statement is closed,  it is difficult to record an accurate capital charge =
for the current month.  Suggestions are welcome.
