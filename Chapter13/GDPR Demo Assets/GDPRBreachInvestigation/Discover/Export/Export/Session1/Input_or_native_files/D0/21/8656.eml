After much delay the capital charge was recorded in CS last night.  Attache=
d is a file with the calculation. There should be a sheet for each business=
 unit. Significant changes were made by some buiness units on Monday and Tu=
esday, so we are reviewing the timing of the capital charge.  If you have a=
ny questions, please contact either me or Steve Schwarzbach.
