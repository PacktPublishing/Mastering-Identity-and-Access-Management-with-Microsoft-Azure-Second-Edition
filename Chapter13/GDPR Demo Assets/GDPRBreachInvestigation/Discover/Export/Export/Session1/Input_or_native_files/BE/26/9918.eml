	Andy,

	This will update you on this matter.  You may recall that it is a collecti=
on matter for about $1,800,000 for breach of spot gas purchase contracts by=
 Triad.  We tried to arbitrate, but Triad wouldn't answer the arbitration (=
even though I got calls from Purnell afterward, who asked if there was some=
 way we could settle the arbitration).  We then filed suit in the 125th Jud=
icial District Court of Harris County, Texas, against both Triad and Purnel=
l, to see if that would smoke them out. =20

	As you know, after filing our original petition, we found an inadvertant t=
echnical error in it that required correction, and at no charge to you refi=
led a first amended petition that corrected the error.  Since then, we serv=
ed the first amended petition and citations on the Secretary of State of th=
e State of Texas, as is allowed by law under such circumstances.  The Secre=
tary of State then forwarded the first amended petition and citations to th=
e addresses we gave them, by certified mail, r.r.r.  At this time, which is=
 long after the expiration of the answer date, no certified mail receipt ha=
s reportedly been received by the Secretary of State from Purnell or Triad.=
  No answer or other pleading has been filed by Triad or Purnell.

	This is not unexpected, given that Triad dodged us during the attempted ar=
bitration.  The caselaw supports the position that we have made effective s=
ervice on both Triad and Purnell, although there is some room to argue that=
 the Secretary of State has to receive a green card back, even if it is mar=
ked "refused".  If we wanted to try to nail this point down by going to the=
 additional expense of personal service on Triad and Purnell, we could, but=
 if Purnell is not going to respond to registered mail, he will likely atte=
mpt to dodge personal service as well.  I am not recommending it.

	We will shortly receive from the Secretary of State the so-called "Whitney=
 Certificate" and file-stamped copies of the citations, which we will file =
with the court, along with a motion for entry of default judgment.  I will =
make sure you see a draft before it is filed.

	We will need to set a hearing on our motion, and produce evidence of our d=
amages.  I would not expect the hearing to take more than an hour.  We prev=
iously filed an affidavit signed by Bryce, as well as a matrix for computin=
g our prejudgment interest (given that there were many spot gas sales, and =
prejudgement interest as to each would start at different times) prepared b=
y Shielah Castro.  I will follow up with them to see if they would be willi=
ng and available to come with me to testify at the hearing, and will of cou=
rse fully prepare them beforehand.  Also, I will need to testify regarding =
our attorneys' fees in this matter.

	Parenthetically, given the length of time this matter has been on file, it=
 has been routinely set on the dismissal for want of prosecution docket.  A=
s you know, it is merely a formality and I will file the appropriate motion=
 to get this taken care of.  I will send you a draft of that if you wish.  =
A hearing is set on this docket for October 23, at which time I presently h=
ave a conflict, and Bonnie has kindly agreed to attend in my place if neces=
sary.  No one else need be at that hearing.

	Please let me know if there is anyone else who needs to be in the loop on =
this.
=09
	I will keep you advised.

	Britt
