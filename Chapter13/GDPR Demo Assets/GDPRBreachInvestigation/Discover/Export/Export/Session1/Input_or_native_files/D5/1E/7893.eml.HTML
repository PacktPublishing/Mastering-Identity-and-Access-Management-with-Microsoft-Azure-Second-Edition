<br>On tuesday of this week after EOTT's staff meeting, I was made aware of a potential environmental estimate problem (too big). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking at ways of potentially dealing with the problem so that Lawrence will feel comfortable not booking a reserve in the 3rd qtr, which may have consequences on the plans we have underway to recapitalize the entity. &nbsp;&nbsp;This means coming up with an answer very quickly. &nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of potential alternatives and I am sure there are more than I will attempt to lay out here.
<br>
<br>1) We could simply make a contribution to EOTT for the sole purpose of environmental cleanup, and if unused will be returned. &nbsp;&nbsp;Seems like an expense item, but doable.
<br>
<br>2) We could provide an insurance policy to EOTT to provide for environmental expenses in excess of the existing policy, for a fee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better expense treatment (we get to manage the reserve) and appears to cover the EOTT issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is an affiliated deal, I guess it would have to go through the audit committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;Potentially the captive could be used.
<br>
<br>3) Provide an accounting answer that might give EOTT a one-time gain to offset the one time reserve set-up. &nbsp;&nbsp;i.e., there is a least an argument that the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portion of the debt on the books represented by the API's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are getting a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal, this should be doable.
<br>
<br>For Lawrence: &nbsp;Jim Bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may have merit, and so I will need some input from you regarding the coverage that exists now and what we would want going forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want us to talk directly with Susan, we will. &nbsp;&nbsp;I am thinking that you are getting a quote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give you the same deal, or maybe even slightly better, to satisfy the audit committee. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I am obviously looking for any help that I can get here, so if there any more ideas I would like to hear them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have questions, feel free to ask. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan is aware of what we are discussing. &nbsp;&nbsp;1) and 3) were his requests to review.
