I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets. &nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again. &nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.
