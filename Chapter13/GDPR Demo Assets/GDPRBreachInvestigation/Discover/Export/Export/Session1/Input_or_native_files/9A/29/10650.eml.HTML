Hi Scott,
<br>
<br>Eric Boyt is back in town and we are following up with him on the Trading Track, &nbsp;&nbsp;as he is a manager currently, he is concerned that this would be a step down. &nbsp;&nbsp;From a salary perspecitve he is on a higher scale than that of the preent trading track individuals... we would have to take him into the trading track as a manager? &nbsp;&nbsp;I am meeting with him today to discuss the TT in more detail.. you may want to touch base with him also on this if you have time.
<br>
<br>Thanks, Karen.

<br>We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron. &nbsp;If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley. &nbsp;If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.
