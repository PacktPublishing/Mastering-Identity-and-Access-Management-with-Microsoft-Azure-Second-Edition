Subject:	Structure for Storage Loans / Deferred Payment Deals


The memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown so=
me interest. =20

Essentially, this deal allows an LDC to defer payment for gas and avoid car=
rying costs (which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your custom=
er's bottom line). =20

We have done two of these deals to date.  ENA has interest in additional de=
als (albeit not an infinite appetite) if the structure allows us to move th=
em off the balance sheet.

Please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an in=
terest. =20

Each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds g=
roup.  Gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them =
through to execution. =20

Please call me with any questions at x36751
