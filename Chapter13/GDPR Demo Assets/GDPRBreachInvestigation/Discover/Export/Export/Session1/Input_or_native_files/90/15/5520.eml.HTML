NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees
<br>
<br>
<br>Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
<br>bills.
<br>NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
<br>people to sign up in the Houston area. &nbsp;The NewPower Connections Remote 
<br>Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
<br>control of their thermostat via the Internet. &nbsp;The program will allow 
<br>thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
<br>including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
<br>PCs. &nbsp;Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
<br>Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
<br>program. &nbsp;For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
<br>to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
<br>the size of your home. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br>Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
<br>Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
<br>pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month. &nbsp;For 
<br>more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
<br>Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
<br>during the week of May 14. &nbsp;To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
<br>a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access. &nbsp;You do not even 
<br>have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate. &nbsp;For more 
<br>information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
<br>connections@newpower.com.
