At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operat=
ions and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in th=
e ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.

We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being inst=
ructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and=
 that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not=
 our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to =
what we have, but not exact.

Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our =
schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with rest=
ating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward=
 from there.

Thanks,  Elaine
