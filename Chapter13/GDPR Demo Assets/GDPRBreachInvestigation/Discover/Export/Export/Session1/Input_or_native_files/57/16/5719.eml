	Elizabeth,
	In the Corp. allocations there are 410,000 dollars budgeted to ETS for cc =
100883.  Mr. Horton has an agreement that none of the costs from this cc sh=
all be assessed to any of the pipes in ETS.  Please have these costs remove=
d from your allocation to ETS.  Thank you.

	Also, can you provide me some information regarding the costs for cc 10022=
2, Gov't Affairs Environment and cc 140196, Business Controls.  We are meet=
ing with Mr. Horton next week and would like to provide him some explanatio=
n of the work that makes up these costs.  If you could respond by Tuesday, =
Oct. 9, that would be very helpful.  Thank you.
	Mary
