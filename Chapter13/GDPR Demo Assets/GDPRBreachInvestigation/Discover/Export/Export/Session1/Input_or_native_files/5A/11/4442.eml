After our meeting today Mike and I met with Pat about some of the recent Ad=
aytum issues and I would like to update you on the progress. =20

With regard to users loosing Contributor data previously entered, we believ=
e they may not be waiting long enough after selecting Save, and closing the=
 window before the save process is complete.  This afternoon Pat sent the d=
etailed instructions below, stressing that users wait until they receive th=
e Done message before closing the window.  She has asked users to let her k=
now if they continue to have this problem.  Due to the size of our applicat=
ions they do take several minutes to open and may take longer to save.

The second issue involves salary calculations in the base models in Adaytum=
 Analyst.  Last week we corrected a formula to resolve this problem.  As it=
 turns out the  changes made in Analyst last week are not there now.  Hoang=
 Vo, who is in Omaha today, asked one of his Adaytum collogues, who is work=
ing on the Corporate project, to look into this.  He contacted Pat and indi=
cated he had experienced this same problem and supplied her with a macro to=
 run after making the changes in Analyst.  Pat updated several applications=
 this evening and will check in the morning to see if it worked.  This issu=
e with saving in Analyst is not related to the saving issue in Contributor.

Additionally, Contributor has not been available for several days recently.=
  This is due to problems with the server that is operated by Networks.  Ho=
ang has worked with the Sunrise technical lead and Networks, and this probl=
em is resolved.


If there any questions, please don't hesitate to call me or Pat.

Thanks, Lee

Subject:	ADAYTUM APPLICATION SAVE PROCESS
Importance:	High

PLEASE BE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW WHEN SAVING DATA YOU HAVE ENTERED=
 INTO YOUR APPLICATION PRIOR TO EXITING:

SAVE WILL SAVE THE DATA BACK TO THE DATABASE.  THIS TAKES MORE TIME THAN WH=
EN YOU OPENED THE APPLICATON BECAUSE YOU ARE SENDING BACK MORE DATA.  YOU M=
UST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE" IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER BEFORE=
 EXITING.  THE HOUR GLASS MAY STOP RUNNING, BUT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DON=
E", IT IS NOT FINISHED SAVING ALL THE DATA.

 << OLE Object: Paintbrush Picture >>=20
 DONE


If you have any questions or experience any further lost data, please call =
me.
Thanks,
Pat
