Tracy,

As you know Project Sunrise no longer has within its scope the development =
of a process for bi-directional data flow between Adaytum and the Data Ware=
house, at a level sufficient for ETS.  Because of this the EST IT group is =
now exploring solutions that will achieve what is needed.  Considering we t=
hought this was being worked on by Sunrise, until a few weeks ago, we have =
a great deal more work ahead of us than earlier expected.

In Operations we will need Hoang Vo working on our project until the end of=
 April 2002 at a minimum.  He is currently scheduled to roll of the project=
 at the end of January.  We need to get with Adaytum and reserve this addit=
ional time.  Do you want to do that or would you rather to go ahead and wor=
k with Fred Ali to make the arrangements.

Thanks, Lee
