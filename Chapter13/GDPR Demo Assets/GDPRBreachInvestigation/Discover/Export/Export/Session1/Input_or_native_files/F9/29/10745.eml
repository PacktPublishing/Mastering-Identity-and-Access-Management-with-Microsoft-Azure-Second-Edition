The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of=
 the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confi=
dent that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We=
 anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we k=
now the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will mee=
t to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any=
 questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.
