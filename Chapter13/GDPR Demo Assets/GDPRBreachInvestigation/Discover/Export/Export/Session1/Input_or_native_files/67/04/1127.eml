Hi Scott,

Eric Boyt is back in town and we are following up with him on the Trading T=
rack,   as he is a manager currently, he is concerned that this would be a =
step down.   From a salary perspecitve he is on a higher scale than that of=
 the preent trading track individuals... we would have to take him into the=
 trading track as a manager?   I am meeting with him today to discuss the T=
T in more detail.. you may want to touch base with him also on this if you =
have time.

Thanks, Karen.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract =
later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we h=
aven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people alread=
y at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckl=
ey.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analyst=
s and associates arrive and do a session then.
