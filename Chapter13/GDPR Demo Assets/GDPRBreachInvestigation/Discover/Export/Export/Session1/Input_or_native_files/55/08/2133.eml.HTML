<br>
<br> &nbsp;John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of &quot;Compressor Fuel&quot; consumed in a &quot;continuing business activity&quot; (Gas services). &nbsp;Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts. &nbsp;
<br>I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1). &nbsp;Have these regulations changed recently? &nbsp;My service may be out of date.
<br>Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

<br>
<br>Dan,
<br>
<br>Here is my initial response. &nbsp;I haven't had time to do too much research on
<br>this, but this preliminarily the Department's position. &nbsp;Sorry this took so
<br>long &nbsp;but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority. &nbsp;jp

<br>&gt; (Account&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L80-30571) Tour, Status and Protest
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; &lt;&lt;File: REG.doc&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;File: industrial use.doc&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt; The trip was very helpful for me as well. &nbsp;I learned a lot from Terry
<br>&gt; the day before. &nbsp;
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; The decision to proceed further will not be my decision, but I will
<br>&gt; prepare an internal analysis, along three main points. &nbsp;In preparing
<br>&gt; this internal analysis, it would be helpful to know your (Colorado's)
<br>&gt; position on the following issues:
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; ASSETS/PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (PSA)
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Our original position related to the characterization of our purchase as
<br>&gt; the purchase of real property, rather than TPP. &nbsp;Regarding your
<br>&gt; acquiescence of the pipeline from the original jeopardy assessment under
<br>&gt; this argument, thanks that is a big chunk of the original assessment.
<br>&gt; My tentative concern under this argument is that foundation, conduit,
<br>&gt; wires, pipe and valves remain on the schedule. &nbsp;The compressor might be
<br>&gt; a bit more difficult to argue under this position.
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Further, Friday, I submitted a copy of the &quot;Operating and Sale
<br>&gt; Agreement&quot;. &nbsp;This agreement will further support my position that the
<br>&gt; PSA was not a purchase of TPP, but was the purchase of a 77% equity
<br>&gt; interest or right to the pipeline's capacity. &nbsp;Using this agreement, my
<br>&gt; position is that the transaction is fully exempt as provided by Reg.
<br>&gt; 26-102.15 (SEE Reg.doc ATTACHED). &nbsp;It says,' &quot;Tangible personal
<br>&gt; property&quot; does not include intangible personal property constituting
<br>&gt; mere rights of action...&quot;' &nbsp;Transwestern is acquiring a &quot;right&quot; to
<br>&gt; capacity on the pipeline, as stipulated under the terms of &quot;Exhibit C&quot;.
<br>&gt; Given the &quot;Operating and Sale Agreement&quot;, do you see this as a viable
<br>&gt; conclusion?
<br>If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
<br>accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
<br>might agree. &nbsp;But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.
<br>
<br>
<br>&gt; COMPRESSOR FUEL/DOMESTIC FUEL
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; I'll get the Compressor and domestic consumption numbers soon, and the
<br>&gt; price will be determined a little later. &nbsp;There are separate meters for
<br>&gt; measuring Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption. &nbsp;Friday, I submitted
<br>&gt; my tax exempt position for Compressor Fuel consumed for Gas Services
<br>&gt; (SEE industrial use.doc BELOW).
<br>&gt; 
<br>I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
<br>Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
<br>to qualify for the exemption. &nbsp;I don't believe it does. &nbsp;I definitely need
<br>more research on this.
<br>
<br>&gt; PENALTY &amp; INTEREST
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; I will be requesting a waiver of penalty and interest on any assessment.
<br>&gt; 
<br>The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Dan
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Good morning. &nbsp;Thanks for the tour of the La Plata Facility. &nbsp;It was
<br>&gt; very
<br>&gt; helpful. &nbsp;I'll remove the $4,803,629 for the 'pipe 30&quot; x .325' from the
<br>&gt; proposed taxable amount. &nbsp;Everything else I'll keep as previously
<br>&gt; determined
<br>&gt; unless I receive additional information from you.
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Also, I look forward to receiving the gas consumed figures for both
<br>&gt; domestic
<br>&gt; use, which I understand is taxable, and the compressor use which remains
<br>&gt; unagreed. If you have a proposal for the valuation of the gas consumed,
<br>&gt; that
<br>&gt; would be helpful also. Thanks again for the tour and your assistance in
<br>&gt; completing the audit. &nbsp;John Petersen, 303-355-0400 x 622.
