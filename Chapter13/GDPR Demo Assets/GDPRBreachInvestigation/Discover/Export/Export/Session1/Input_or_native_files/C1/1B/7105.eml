^Below is an update on the Adaytum Consolidated Model:

1) BU Basic Cubes' Training =3D> last week (10/22 - 10/26), two training se=
ssions were held - EEOS and EGAS. Provided in the training sessions were Us=
er Documentation, which included screen prints of Manager screens, as well =
as a word document with additional user instructions and screen shots of th=
e data cubes. Also included were the Adaytum excel add-in reports (both sum=
mary and financial statements). Additional training sessions are scheduled =
for the next two weeks. If you have not done so already, please let me know=
 your availability. The sessions lasts approximately 4 hours, and is done "=
on-site".

NOTE: Most Enron computers have a minimum of 128K of RAM. In order for fast=
er processing of data and accessing the cubes, we are recommending that eve=
ryone upgrade to an additional 128K of RAM (totalling 256K RAM). The cost o=
f this upgrade is a nominal amount (under $25), and is well worth the inves=
tment.

To check the amount of memory on your machine, please do the following comm=
