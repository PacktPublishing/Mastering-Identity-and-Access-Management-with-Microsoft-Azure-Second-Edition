The rest of you better move fast because there is a limited amount of
sleeping space!

If you misunderstood, we will be staying over only Saturday night.  Rod and
I will meet you at the Starbucks in Town & Country Mall behind the Chevron
station at 8:30am on Saturday June 9th.  Once you pick up your latte, we

appropriate meal), I repeat Lunch for Saturday.
