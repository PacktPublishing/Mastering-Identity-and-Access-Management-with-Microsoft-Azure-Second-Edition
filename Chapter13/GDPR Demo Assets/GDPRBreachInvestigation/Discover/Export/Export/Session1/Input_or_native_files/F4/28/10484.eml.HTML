<br>After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being
<br>amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
<br>thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
<br>$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach
<br>thanks.

<br>
<br>
<br>Hi Tracy, 
<br>
<br>Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
<br>morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
<br>previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
<br>expenditures. 
<br>
<br>For the O&amp;M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
<br>for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
<br>not condusive to SAP type sorting. 
<br>
<br>Also, note that all O&amp;M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
<br>The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
<br>November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
<br>to the final one. 
<br>
<br>Let me know if you have any questions.
