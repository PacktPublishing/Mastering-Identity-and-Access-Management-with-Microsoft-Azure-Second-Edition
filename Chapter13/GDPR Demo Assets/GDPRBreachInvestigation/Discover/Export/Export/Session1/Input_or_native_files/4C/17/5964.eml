Rita and All:

All:
The contract maximum of 4.45% (not 4.5%) is based on both Field and Mainlin=
e fuel for the particular MID (10, 11, 12 and/or 13) in which the gas is re=
ceived.  The attached spreadsheet is a history of the relevant MID fuels.  =
When the contract originated in December 1995 the MID average was below 4% =
and the contract generated modest revenue for NNG.

The 6/1/97 tariff revision greatly increased mainline fuels, especially in =
MID 11 where the majority of the contract volume is received, where the fue=
l jumped from 1.48% to 2.90%.  The 6/1/97 revision increased the volume wei=
ghted average fuel (a measure valid for comparison purposes only) from 3.81=
% to 4.65%, which until the 8/1/01 revision to 4.71% was the zenith.

Mainline fuel appears to be the problem: it has increased from 1.84% effect=
ive 6/1/99 to 2.25% effective 6/1/00 to 2.66% effective 8/1/01.  This .82% =
increment makes the difference between profit and our current situation.

Rita:
Can you tell us how we got here and what areas we could focus our attention=
 on to potentially remedy the problem?  Which station have increased fuel c=
onsumption over the years?  And how are prior period adjustments made?  Can=
 you send me the calculation spreadsheets for the relevant tariff revision =
periods?

All:
Ideas/comments/solutions?

NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.

We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fu=
el based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.
This out of balance collection goes to trackers.  We could lower the amount=
s over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this co=
ntract goes short.  (stop charging out-of-balance retention has other probl=
ems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001.  This=
 is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part.  That is, we ne=
ed to make these two contracts long to the system each month.  Or, put an O=
BA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems a=
ssocated with it).

Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see =
if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and =
Tracy Geaccone to discuss.=20

The non-controllable factors are NNG's Field fuel rate keeps increasing mak=
ing it consistently over the 4.5%, and lower gas prices increase the exposu=
re to EPPI.

I still need to understand why we are at the 4.45% and what we can do in th=
e future if anything to control it.   Can someone help me with this?

Thanks

I have attached a summary and schedules which indicate the following.

EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69
Oneok owes NNG	$  92,774.99
Net amount due is	$246,383.70  Per Dan Fancler

Oneok invoices total $301,383.96.  Oneok has not recognized that some month=
s they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.
 << File: GPM 101021  101073 Recalculation.xls >> Oneok is pushing hard for=
 the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG m=
arketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Je=
nnifer Lev.
