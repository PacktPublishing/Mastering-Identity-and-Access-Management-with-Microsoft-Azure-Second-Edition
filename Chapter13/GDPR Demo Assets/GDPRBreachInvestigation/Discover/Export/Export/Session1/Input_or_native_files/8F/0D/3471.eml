After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still be=
ing
amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach
thanks.=20

Hi Tracy,=20

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorr=
ow=20
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not=20
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital=20
expenditures.=20

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-ou=
t=20
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is=
=20
not condusive to SAP type sorting.=20

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year=
.=20
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late=20
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these resul=
ts=20
to the final one.=20

Let me know if you have any questions.
