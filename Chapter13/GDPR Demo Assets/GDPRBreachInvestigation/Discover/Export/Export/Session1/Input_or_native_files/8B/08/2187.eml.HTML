<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; What a great time!! Thanks for all the positive attitudes and fun thoughts
<br>&gt; by all!
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; We caught lots of fish, we kept too many reds, we burned gallons of gas,
<br>&gt; and ate all the Etouffee! What else is needed?
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; We thank all the returning fishermen, and welcome all the first timers !
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; This year I think the fish got away with more of our baits than I
<br>&gt; remembered last year. We broke only one rod like last year. We caught
<br>&gt; bigger and more Redfish this year. We caught bigger trout but didn't keep
<br>&gt; as many as last year thank goodness. We &nbsp;had better food this year ( At
<br>&gt; least for one of the meals!). What else could we have done better? We
<br>&gt; welcome your input for next years adventure! Some people have suggested
<br>&gt; early June dates. Others suggest Cocodrie or Grand Isle. As with
<br>&gt; everything else we will go with the consensus of the group that respond.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Thanks again for making Catchin' 2001 a great memory for a great group of
<br>&gt; people!!

<br>&gt; One more important part of our business, we need a little prayer and
<br>&gt; positive momentum for Mike. He was our sparkplug in keeping everything
<br>&gt; lite and cheerful and now he could use a little support from his fishing
<br>&gt; buddies. Please get a copy of this to those that are not copied on this
<br>&gt; email at your earliest convenience. Rather than spend time on the Islander
<br>&gt; talking about his challenge with everyone , Mike has written a little
<br>&gt; summary of the situation for all of his fshing buddies:
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; &quot;Dear Friends, c/o Clarence;
<br>&gt; I wanted to let each of you know how much I enjoyed being out in the Gulf
<br>&gt; &amp; Fishing with you. Some of &nbsp;you are aware that I (Mike) have been
<br>&gt; diagnosed with Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer. I will have the Tumor removed
<br>&gt; Wednesday May 23rd and will &nbsp;be in the Hospital for about a week then home
<br>&gt; for about 6 weeks ( They say). We'll see How all that works out. I should
<br>&gt; be ready to fish and Hunt by August.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; I feel very fortunate that I have a wife that is understanding enough to
<br>&gt; not have a fit whilst I'm out with friends fishing the week prior to
<br>&gt; surgery. I also feel fortunate to have as many friends as I do &amp; I
<br>&gt; consider all of you my friends. I hope that we continue the tradition of
<br>&gt; at least one big &quot;CW Event&quot; per year. I'll keep each of you posted as I
<br>&gt; can, or you can call the house and speak with Kathryn @ 281-499-9700.
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Your Friend,
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; MIKE
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; Just one more thing from CW;
<br>&gt; Rob, please get this to Scott and Randy so they can add their prayers and
<br>&gt; support , too!
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt; With your moral support and prayers we will get Mike through this
<br>&gt; challenge so we can enjoy many more years of going &quot;Catchin' together.
