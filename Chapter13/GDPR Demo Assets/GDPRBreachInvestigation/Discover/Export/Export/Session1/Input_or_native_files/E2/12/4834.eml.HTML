Kam, last year when this deal was set up, I set up deal tickets extending 
<br>into the future for 5 years (I would have extended it all the way to 2010 but 
<br>the Risk people back then asked me not to). &nbsp;I have a new ticket for each 
<br>season since the volumes at each primary point and fuel change over the years 
<br>and by season. &nbsp;Extending Sitara 217969 through is going to be doubling 
<br>volumes for one and secondly, it won't reflect the correct primary points for 
<br>each season. &nbsp;I would really like to be consulted about these kind of changes 
<br>before they are made and maybe we and Scott Neal could sit down and figure 
<br>out a better way to keep up with the value. &nbsp;I'll run some facilitation 
<br>reports and see if this has caused us any trouble that we may need to fix.
<br>
<br>Thanks, Sabra

<br>Sabra,
<br>
<br>I have extended the current FP&amp;L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal 
<br>(2/2010).
<br>
<br>Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.
<br>
<br>I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and 
<br>locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you 
<br>have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge 
<br>deal.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>
<br>Kam
<br>
<br>
<br>ps. &nbsp;Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future. &nbsp;
<br>Sorry for the trouble.
