Are there any cash issues surrounding this?  If so, who is going to handle?

Stan,  I wanted to update you on the status of our efforts to implement tra=
ding activities and what steps remain.

Accomplished:
Trade system implemented (Caminus system)
Training completed for traders and support personnel
Trade Policy and limits approved
Financial / Risk controls in place thorugh Finance (Jerry Peters, Dan Fancl=
er)
Brokerage contracts executed (Paribas, ABN Amro)
Trade strategies have been reviewed

Remaining:
Fund brokerage contracts with $500,000 margin requirement (we are paid 95% =
of the 30 day T-bill rates on the account)

We are working with Rod and his group as we continue to get this part of ou=
r business up to speed.  As we discussed with you before, both Dave and I h=
ave the accountability for the rewards to outweigh the risks for this buisi=
ness component and fully expect this to contribute to our earnings objectiv=
es.  If you have any more questions about the commercial business plans ple=
ase let me know and we'll get something set up, otherwise we'll fund the br=
okerage accounts and continue with our efforts.

Thanks,

Kent
