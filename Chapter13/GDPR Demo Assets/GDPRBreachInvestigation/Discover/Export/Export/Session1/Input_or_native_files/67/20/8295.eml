Maureen Smith and Ruth Concannon have raised some issues regarding how Broo=
klyn Union Gas is in the books, specifically, the final contract year (11/1=
/03 - 10/31/04) is not in the books at all (which will produce a gain when =
booked), and the current deal structure is telescoped incorrectly at Transc=
o Zones 1,3, & 4 when it should be telescoped 17% at Zone 1, 25% at Zone 2,=
 and 58% at Zone 3.  This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the=
 gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss. =
=20

The purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & =
Frank before making any changes to the books.  Please let me know if you ha=
ve any other questions.  Thanks!

Kelli
