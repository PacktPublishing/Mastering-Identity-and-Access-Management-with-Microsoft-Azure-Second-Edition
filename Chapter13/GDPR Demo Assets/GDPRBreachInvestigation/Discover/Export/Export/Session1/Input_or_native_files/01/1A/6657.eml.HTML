Actually, we are working with each group to see why their charges are up and we are trying to get them reduced. &nbsp;We will discuss with Stan at our ETS review and do further follow up if necessary. &nbsp;We actually met with Terry West and Dawn Derr last week to get their input and contacts.

<br>Tracy,
<br>Jim had wanted to meet with the business heads that charges us thru the corp charges to hear their business justifications and assumptions used in allocating costs to us. &nbsp;I just want to check if you are doing this with Stan. &nbsp;If you are, then maybe Jim can just sit in the same meeting. &nbsp;Please let me know. &nbsp;Thank you.
