<br>Mary - Regarding the 100883 and 1000222, Mike Terraso will be meeting with Mr. Horton tomorrow. &nbsp;Regarding 140196, I've attached below the description of the group. &nbsp;Additionally, John Brindle, the cost center owner, mentioned that both Mr. Horton and Phil Lowry are aware of the group's activities and costs.
<br>
<br>Please let me know if you need anything further.
<br>
<br>Regards, 
<br>Elizabeth

<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Corp. allocations there are 410,000 dollars budgeted to ETS for cc 100883. &nbsp;Mr. Horton has an agreement that none of the costs from this cc shall be assessed to any of the pipes in ETS. &nbsp;Please have these costs removed from your allocation to ETS. &nbsp;Thank you.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, can you provide me some information regarding the costs for cc 100222, Gov't Affairs Environment and cc 140196, Business Controls. &nbsp;We are meeting with Mr. Horton next week and would like to provide him some explanation of the work that makes up these costs. &nbsp;If you could respond by Tuesday, Oct. 9, that would be very helpful. &nbsp;Thank you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary
