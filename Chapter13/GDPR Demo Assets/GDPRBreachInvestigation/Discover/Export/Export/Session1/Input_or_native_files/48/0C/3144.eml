We are turning into Corp today, (3CE), (34.9).  This is a variance of (8.3)=
 to what you have below.

NEPCO =3D (8.5) - due to project profit adjustments on LS Power/Kendall, IL=
, Cogentrix/Jenks, OK, and E.Coast Power/Linden, NJ.
EEOS =3D      .2 - Puerto Rico 2.0, Bonus accrual (1.0), and misc. other (.=
8).

FYI,  We are currently looking at the NEPCO projects to see if they require=
 further writedowns.

Are we reporting the 4Q through EGS and not Wholesale?  Please let me know.
