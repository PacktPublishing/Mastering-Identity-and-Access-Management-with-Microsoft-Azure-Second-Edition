Attached is the ENA Allocations Schedule with Revised HR numbers. &nbsp;In addition, I have once again included a separate file with further support schedules for the various Support Departments. &nbsp;Please note that the most efficient way to resolve any disagreement with any of the allocations is to contact the Support Department contact directly. &nbsp;I have included those persons' names on the 2002 Schedule. &nbsp;I will be happy to assist in answering any questions that I can, but am unable to revise the allocations without a request from that person.
<br>
<br>All alloctions will be made based on actuals during 2002. &nbsp;Actuals will either be assessed on a monthly basis or potentially trued up on a quarterly basis.
<br>
<br> &nbsp;
<br>Thanks,

<br>Please be advised that our HR group has requested a subsequent change and this will once again result in a revision of the HR allocations.
<br>

<br>
<br>Attached please find an updated Allocations schedule from ENA for 2002 Plan. &nbsp;Please note that the considerable increase in many of the allocations is caused by the decision to include an allocation of bonuses for each support department. &nbsp;These bonus numbers are based on historical data and are calculated at a high level. &nbsp;Bonuses were not allocated in the prior year and therefore will cause a considerable variance year on year.
<br>
<br>Please contact me with any questions you may have or additional information you may need so that we can resolve any issues in an efficient manner. &nbsp;After resolution of questions, please provide me your final agreement on these numbers via e:mail.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Edie
