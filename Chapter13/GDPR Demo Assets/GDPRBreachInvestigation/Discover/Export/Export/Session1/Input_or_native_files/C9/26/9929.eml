Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal=20
(2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and=20
locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you=
=20
have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge=
=20
deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future. =20
Sorry for the trouble.
