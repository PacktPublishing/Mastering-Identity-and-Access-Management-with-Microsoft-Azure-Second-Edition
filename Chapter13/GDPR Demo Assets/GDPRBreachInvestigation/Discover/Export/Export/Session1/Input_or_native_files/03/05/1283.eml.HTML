This is Saunders entire world plus Borcyk's world for tax. &nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting and Reporting are consolidated, not worth splitting and the cost estimate should be a net Enron estimate.
<br>
<br>Call Kirk Stevens for the Portland info and Tod (unless you know who else) for the EREC world. &nbsp;&nbsp;What about Wessex?

<br>
<br>Lets discuss this before I start pulling data. &nbsp;I want to make sure I pull in the right groups. &nbsp;I have a call into Corp to try to figure out what they are getting at here.

<br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request: Current Headcount
<br>
<br>Hi everyone. &nbsp;I have yet another request for which I need your input. &nbsp;Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s). &nbsp;
<br>
<br>What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey. &nbsp;For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments. &nbsp;It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world). &nbsp;I say &quot;department&quot; because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc. &nbsp;If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.
<br>
<br>The data needs to be as recent as possible. &nbsp;Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1. &nbsp;If you have more recent data, that would be great. &nbsp;At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.) &nbsp;It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Additionally, if you can provide me with a &quot;current estimate&quot; for the groups you report, that would be ideal. &nbsp;I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&amp;A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.
<br>
<br>The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both. &nbsp;If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss.
<br>
<br>Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon. &nbsp;This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.
<br>
<br>If you have any questions, please give me a call.
<br>
<br>Thanks, 
<br>Steve
