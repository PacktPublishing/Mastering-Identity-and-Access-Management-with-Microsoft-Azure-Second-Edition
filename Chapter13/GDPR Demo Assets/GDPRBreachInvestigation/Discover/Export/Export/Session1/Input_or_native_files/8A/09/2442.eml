Attached is a draft analysis of comparing revenues from different uses of s=
ome of the TW excess retained fuel for this year:

Keep San Juan shippers whole and get imbalance gas back by year end

Cut San Juan shippers deliveries and sell excess retained fuel right away

A break even settled San Juan imbalance gas cash out price is determined.

If the settled cash out price is above $4.23/MMBtu, keeping the shippers wh=
ole is a better alternative.

Please review and comment on the draft analysis and make sure that I didn't=
 misinterpret the information provided by you.

Thanks! =20
