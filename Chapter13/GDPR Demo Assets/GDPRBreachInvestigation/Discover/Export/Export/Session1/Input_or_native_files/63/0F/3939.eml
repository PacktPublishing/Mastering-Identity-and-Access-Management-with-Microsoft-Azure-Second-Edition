Scott,

As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotia=
tions along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company=
.

Just to give you some facts:
We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party. Wi=
lliams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in te=
rm, this is breach of contract. We currently have over 800 deals pending ex=
ecution as they are not sending paper.=20

We have been unsuccessful for several months and the hold-up seems to be wi=
th Williams Legal group. Their Credit group is in favor of this Master as I=
 understand it.
Below are the several people we have been in contact with over the last sev=
eral months.

Legal:  Kelly Knowlton @ 918-573-5278

Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal is handling the negotiations on our side and=
 can be reached at 713-853-7658.
If you have any questions, please call me x54099.
Many thanks for your help !
Best Regards
Ellen
