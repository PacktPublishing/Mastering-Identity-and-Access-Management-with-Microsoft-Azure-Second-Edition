So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?
The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Colum=
n A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be m=
ore realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there cou=
ld be $11K/month going forward.=20
The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property=
 from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings =
concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant. =20
If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.=20

I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.  He isn't Dan's boss, but they're in the s=

Has Jerry Moore from the tax group been involved in this?  Do I have anythi=

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of "Co=
mpressor Fuel" consumed in a "continuing business activity" (Gas services).=
  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter=
 within the company and validate the facts. =20
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.=
1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of=
 date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption f=
or the audit period.

Dan,
Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  j=

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

>=20
I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

> PENALTY & INTEREST
>=20

>=20
The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above t=
he auditor level.
