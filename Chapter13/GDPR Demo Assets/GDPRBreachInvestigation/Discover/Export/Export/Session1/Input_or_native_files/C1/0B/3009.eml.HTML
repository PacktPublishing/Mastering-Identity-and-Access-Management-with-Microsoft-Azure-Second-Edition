<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the budget session, I thought I needed to make sure one more process is started and in order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance costs have risen and there may be a disconnect between expectations and actual results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to think that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Operating Companies in a short time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so that everyone is dealing with the same information. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a right to match the deal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed &nbsp;and then follow that up with the information &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to go out in the RFP.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Operating Company (OC) wishes &nbsp;to secure a &quot;market price&quot; for their insurance:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing. &nbsp;The Broker is subject to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approval. &nbsp;Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld. &nbsp;&nbsp;An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM, &nbsp;the necessary underwriting information.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages, &nbsp;limits, and deductibles they require for their business.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manager within Enron.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OC will elect the program and price they &nbsp;prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate program.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a &quot;correspondent&quot; within the established Enron Broker Network. &nbsp;This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because obviously we need to get started ASAP.
