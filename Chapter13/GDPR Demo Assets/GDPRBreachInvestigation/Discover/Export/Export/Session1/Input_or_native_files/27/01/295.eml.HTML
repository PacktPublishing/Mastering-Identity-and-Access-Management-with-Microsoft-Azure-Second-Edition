<br>
<br>Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW. &nbsp;The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees. &nbsp;This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.
