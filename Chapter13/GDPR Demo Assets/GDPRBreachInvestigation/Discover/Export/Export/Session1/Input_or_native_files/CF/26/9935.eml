Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.
=20
I'm not real certain of the project organization, but I'll give it a try:
=20
The Adaytum implementation is a corporate project managed under the Project=
 Sunrise umbrella.  Joe Darensburg is the lead reporting to Jan Johnson.  B=
oth of these people are originally from corp accounting.  I believe Jan has=
 moved back into the corp accounting group and the overall project is now r=
eporting to Susan Bellinghausen from the ISC.
=20
ETS has it's own project which is being led by Tracy Geaccone (ETS Consolid=
ations, which reports to Rod Hayslett).  I believe this was originally set =
up to address ETS' specific planning/forecasting needs and to dovetail into=
 the corp level implementation.  Hoang Vo is an Adaytum consultant working =
for Tracy.
=20
Lee Baker manages planning and forecasting for the Operations Services Grou=
p, which reports to Elaine Concklin and is part of Morris Brassfield's orga=
nization.  I believe Elaine has a dotted line to Rod as well.  Lee's team u=
ses Hoang quite a bit as well.
=20
I'll call you in a few minutes and we can discuss further.

Cheryl Perchal is going to coordinate a phone conference with you, Teri Gal=
issini and Hoang Vo sometime this week.
We have many questions, not just how actuals could feed into Adaytum for cu=
rrent estimate.
=20
You can maybe help me understand how project management is organized for ET=
S's Adaytum project(s).
1. I understand Teri G is project lead.  Does she report to Rod Hayslett?  =
Is anyone from Steve Hotte's area involved?
2. Is the project being capitalized or 100% expensed?  No one here has anyt=
hing like SOW, project authorization, capital project coding for timesheets=
, status reporting, etc.
=20
Thanks, Fred

Fred,
=20
I'm out of the office today but took a few minutes to check in and keep the=
 mountain of email from piling too high.  With regard to the actuals item m=
entioned below, this came to light when my team was doing research on devel=
oping cost center reporting out of the finacial data warehouse.  Next Wedne=
sday we have a detailed planning meeting on requirements after which we wil=
l be asking the ISC (supports sap, adaytum, data warehouse, etc.)  for an e=
stimate and schedule.  Basically what we are shooting for is plan in the da=
ta warehouse to support cost center/variance reporting and actuals in Adayt=
um to support analysis and development of current estimates and forecasts. =
=20
=20
I call you Monday and we can discuss further.  Have a good Thanksgiving.
Greg =20

Rita's consultant rate is $150.  Hoang's rate is either $150 or $215.  I do=
n't like paying for redesign on a product that should handle large cubes.  =
I plan to talk with Greg Lewis about this issue.

I am out of the office tomorrow and wanted to get some communication out on=
 the Adaytum O&M project.=20
I haven't had a chance to talk to Phil on this so this is only my opinion o=
n the project so far.  This will just be a brief rundown. I can expand upon=
 any of the items at your request.

Planned this week:=20
Call Hoang Vo on a couple issues.  (See accomplished below)=20
Decipher what Rita accomplished in the model and what still needs to be com=
pleted.=20
Understand the model.=20

Accomplished this week:=20
Called Hoang Vo on 11-19.  Issues:=20
1. Can't open large cubes.  Hoang knows this is a problem.  There is a simi=
lar issue with a Houston application which they need to redesign. =20

2.  Importing to contributor after allocations ran. Hoang is working on a s=
cript.  He will send to us once he has it finished.  Until then we could do=
 it manually but Hoang would have to step us though this process taking awa=
y from his time writing the script. Side note: if we can't get the allocati=
ons back to contributor, then the users (me right now) can't do much testin=
g besides inputting.

Documentation.  Phil and I have been going through d-lists and d-cubes tryi=
ng to determine the purpose of each.  Discovered some d-lists and d-cubes t=
hat we may not need and documented questions on others.  This written docum=
entation should assist new users of our application.

Cube Renaming - We have renamed the Merit SBP Model to just Merit Model.  T=
his is the only bright spot in the week as renaming cubes seems to be a sim=
ple process with the name change occurring in all the appropriate places fo=
r links and macros to still work.   =20


Outstanding Issues:=20
Phil and I have come to the conclusion that we need further assistance from=
 Hoang or another consultant familiar with this application.  We are in nee=
d of a summary, manager build, and some sort of documented process on how t=
o run this application.  I am not at all comfortable with the application i=
n its present state but feel we can make some progress if we had a complete=
 roadmap of the application and someone to ask questions of.

In a phone conference this afternoon, we were told that getting actuals int=
o the Adaytum O&M application would not be ready for January 2002 close.  E=
TS thought that the whole actuals process was being addressed under the Pro=
ject Sunrise umbrella which is not the case.  Now ETS must champion this ef=
fort. It is being headed up by Greg Lewis but there is not an estimated com=
pletion date.
