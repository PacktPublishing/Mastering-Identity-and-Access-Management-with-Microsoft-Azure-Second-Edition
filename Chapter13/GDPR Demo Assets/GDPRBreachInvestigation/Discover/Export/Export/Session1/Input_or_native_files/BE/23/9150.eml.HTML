<br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oneok Claim on EPPI
<br>
<br>
<br>EPPI Claim for 2000-2001
<br>
<br>Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI) &nbsp;assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%. &nbsp;NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.
<br>
<br>The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.
<br>
<br>
<br>Prior Claim (1997-1999)
<br>
<br>On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.
<br>
<br>During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made. &nbsp;
