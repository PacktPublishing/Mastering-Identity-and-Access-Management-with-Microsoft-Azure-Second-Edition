<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submitted the Parking Provision outline to Bay Gas last week after our meeting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to circle back to determine where we are relative to getting pricing pulled together
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the gas portion. &nbsp;I've been in need to put a hard offer in front of this customer for several
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks now. &nbsp;They are in the process of making a critical decision &amp; I would like to have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something in hand that values the Parking optionality. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mk

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what the latest discussions you've had since our last meeting, but I need to get this 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concept outlined and in the hands of my customer. &nbsp;They are making their decision any day now 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I believe this structure will add to the value of our Compression Service and reduce our 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dependence on the minimum load factor. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've attached a basic outline as I see it. &nbsp;Please review or we will discuss at our 3:00 meeting today.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to define or understand our (Enron's) wish list as well as a relative value at a minimum. &nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need to get the specifics to my customer tomorrow since it's not going to happen today. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ultimately need to have a price for the gas that ECS would be receiving ASAP. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mk
