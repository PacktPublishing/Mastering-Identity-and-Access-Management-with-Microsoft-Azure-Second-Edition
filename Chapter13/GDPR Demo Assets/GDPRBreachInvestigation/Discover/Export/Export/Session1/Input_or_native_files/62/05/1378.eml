I think you may be reading more into this than was meant by the memo.  Ther=
e are alot of business entities that roll-up into EGS.  There usually is so=
me flexibility in each business unit regarding their quarterly numbers.  By=
 having all the facts we as a team can present them to Causey.  We may very=
 well be able to accelerate earnings in one group for a quarter to make up =
deficiencies in another group.  It would be nice to be able to discuss thes=
e options as a unit before reporting them to corporate.  No one is trying t=
o manage anything other than to give Rick a complete assessment as to what =
EGS results look like and the fexibility we have as a unit.  This is all Tr=
acy was trying to convey.  No one has asked that you not respond to corpora=
te only that we have a chance to see what our numbers look like as an entit=
y before releasing to corporate.  I don't think Rick has any problem with t=
his but I will ask Rod by this memo to check with Rick to see if he does.

I think this is pretty consistent with the way wholesale and retail report =
to corporate.

Thanks.

I would like to discuss the below message when you have a chance.  There ha=
s been a lot of distrust and concern over "managed information" with respec=
t to the international assets.  My team has overcome this by going out of o=
ur way to cooperate and be transparent with corp the last year and a half. =
 I am uncomfortable asking my people not to respond to corp requests for in=
formation.  I also think the tone of the message is demeaning and could hav=
e a morale impact on my folks.

Mark,=20

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2n=
d CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferre=
d out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Me=
rchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This=
 does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe=
 to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will =
send you those numbers when we are done.
