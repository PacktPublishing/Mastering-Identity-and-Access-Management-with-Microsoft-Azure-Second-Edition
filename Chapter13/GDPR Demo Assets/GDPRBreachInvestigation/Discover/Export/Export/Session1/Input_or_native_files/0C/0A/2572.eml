Here is the attached spreadsheet showing the variances of the Revised PAF c=
ompared to the Original PAF for the Beatrice Trailblazer to C Line (C.01462=
5).  As we discussed, it appears likely that there will be savings from oth=
er parts of the total project (on the TW side) that can be used to cover th=
e increased costs.  I propose we revise this particular PAF number to cover=
 the additional costs and decrease the TW PAF by a like cost.  The total pr=
oject economics remain unchanged.=20

(Rod based on this solution, I don't think it needs to be discussed at Stan=
's meeting Monday).=20

Jerry, I will get with you next week on the Peak Day 2000 discussion
