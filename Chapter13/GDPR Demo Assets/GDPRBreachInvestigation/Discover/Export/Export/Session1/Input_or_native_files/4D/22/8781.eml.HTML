<br>
<br>We are scheduled to have a follow up meeting on the 2002 Plan with Stan on Thursday, Oct. 25 at 3:00. &nbsp;I am not sure if you will call in for that or if Tod is handling the meeting. &nbsp;We can go over Lay review ideas again then. &nbsp;The agenda for November 1 has you at 4:30 Houston time. &nbsp;Will that work for you? &nbsp;If not, are you comfortable with Tod doing it. &nbsp;Just let me know what I can do to help.
<br>
<br>Thanks
<br>

<br>I am in Germany on Nov 1 but will call in. &nbsp;Let me know what time Stan wants to do the dry run (I will be 7 hours ahead of Houston; it would be best for me if I could call after 8 pm German time). &nbsp;I know we will only have 20 minutes with Ken per business unit. &nbsp;After sitting through my presentation to Stan, I would appreciate your recommendations on what we should focus on for EREC. &nbsp;Thanks.
