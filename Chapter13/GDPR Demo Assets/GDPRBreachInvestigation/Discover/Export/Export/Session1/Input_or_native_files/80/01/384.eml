This is for EREC not Azurix.  So, don't worry about it.

Tracy-

I need some help on what this is.  Admittedly, it's only $117k, but we only=
 have 3 employees, and will likely have less next year.  Can we discuss?

Michael

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net=
 Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to sever=
al changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit alloca=
tions, and reductions in ENW expenditures. =20

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital fo=
r your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long dist=
ance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessme=
nts ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses=
 ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number =
is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollar=
s already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will =
answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there =
is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please repl=
y back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list =
for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay
