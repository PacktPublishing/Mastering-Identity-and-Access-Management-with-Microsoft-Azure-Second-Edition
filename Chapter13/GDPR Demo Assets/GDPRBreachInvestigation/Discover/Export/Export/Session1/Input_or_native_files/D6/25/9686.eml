The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, Nove=
mber 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While th=
e business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is cert=
ain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has bee=
n eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However=
, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we w=
ant to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference =
will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a hum=
orous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video=
 can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  Howe=
ver, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no=
 more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to w=
ork with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive vid=
eo.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to E=
nron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their inten=
tion to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also nee=
d to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to=
 be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and =
soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact my=
self or Mary Clark. =20
