<br>Andrea,
<br>
<br>The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and 
<br>Leonidas Savas. &nbsp;Both are from LSU and
<br>start this summer as Associates. &nbsp;Both have expressed their strong desire to 
<br>have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
<br>do a great job for us. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you concur, please make a note to place them in 
<br>Trading for their first rotation . &nbsp;I have attached both resumes for your 
<br>reference.
<br>
<br>thanks,
<br>
<br>Scott
