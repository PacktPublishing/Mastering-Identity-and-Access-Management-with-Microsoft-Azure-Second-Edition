<br>
<br>
<br>The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday . &nbsp;We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence. &nbsp;We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month. &nbsp;As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.
<br>
<br>We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.
<br>
<br>We'll be in touch as the details unfold. &nbsp;In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.
