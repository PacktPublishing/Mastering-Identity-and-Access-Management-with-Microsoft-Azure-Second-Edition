To all supervisors of Associates and Analysts
<br>
<br>The Associates and Analysts will be divided into 4 final ranking meetings for the mid-year 2001 PRC. &nbsp;These meetings are scheduled as follows:
<br>EES Associate &amp; Analyst Final Meeting - June 8

<br>
<br>The Associates and Analysts will be ranked within the following Peer Groups:
<br>Analyst 1 - Analysts with up to one year of service (hired between 3/1/00 and 2/28/01)
<br>Analyst 2 - Analysts with greater than one year of service (hired prior to 3/1/00)

<br>
<br>Associate and Analyst Ranking Process
<br>Analysts and Associates hired on or after 3/1/01, will receive feedback only, all others will receive both a PRC ranking and feedback.
<br>Each Business Unit Supervisor will be responsible for providing a pre-ranking to the PRC Rep. &nbsp;The PRC Reps have access to the consolidated feedback for each assigned Associate and Analyst. &nbsp;Please be sure that you have met with the assigned PRC Rep prior to the final Associate and Analyst meeting for your business unit. &nbsp;(Your business unit HR department may choose to set up pre-ranking meetings - check with your HR representative). &nbsp;The final ranking for each Analyst an Associate will be determined through a cross calibration in each of the final meetings. &nbsp;In these final meetings, the Analysts and Associates will be represented by a PRC Rep from their Business Unit who should be familiar with their accomplishments.
