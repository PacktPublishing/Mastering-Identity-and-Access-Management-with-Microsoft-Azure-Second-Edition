 I met with Rod this morning and he reviewed and revised the category of th=
e capital projects.  Please see attached spreadsheet for the new informatio=
n.  Once again I will let you determine how you want to present the number =
on the capital form so you can account for rounding for the different proje=
cts.  Sorry this is even later but I am working as fast as I am able.  =20

I am preparing booklets with the capital project write ups for each functio=
nal area and will have them to you today.=20

Steve I will work with you on how you want to handle.  =20
