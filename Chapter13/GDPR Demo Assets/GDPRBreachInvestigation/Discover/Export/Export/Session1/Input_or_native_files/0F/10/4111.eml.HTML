<br>
<br>Legal is requesting some information for the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing related to the merger by the end of the day tomorrow. &nbsp;Please see below. &nbsp;I have listed the description of the codes below. &nbsp;The information is requested for the year 2000. &nbsp;Please provide a list of states in which Enron subsidiaries (entities incorporated in the U.S. only) which earned revenues in 2000 (1) have customers, (2) conduct their operations, or (3) have physical office locations (as specified below) for the following NAICS codes only. &nbsp;The revenues should include intercompany revenues.
<br>
<br>I am attaching a file which was compiled a few months ago, containing the largest Enron companies earning revenues in 2000 and their respective NAICS codes. &nbsp;This is not all-inclusive, but is a good start.
<br>
<br>Please let me know if you have any questions.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Sal

<br>Also, please provide the 1997 and 2000 revenue data for Portland General by NAICS code.

<br>
<br>I know that his is short notice, but I have just been given the information and has made this request immediately to you. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they have requested to have it by the end of the day tomorrow (11/27). &nbsp;They will let me know if they can give additional time. &nbsp;If you should have any questions, please let me know.
