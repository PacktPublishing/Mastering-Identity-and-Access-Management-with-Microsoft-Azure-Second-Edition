Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit agai=
nst Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit w=
as filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM. =20

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the cou=
rt in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees=
.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until pa=
id by Oasis. =20

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.
