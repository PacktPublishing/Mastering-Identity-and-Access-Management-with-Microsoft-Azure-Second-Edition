Tracy,

Attached is the file you requested.  I have made substantial assumptions re=
garding the requested content, and the content provided may not be what was=
 intended to be requested.

Please note the following:

- The EREC earnings figures are from the Hyperion system as of Oct. 19th
- The 2001-02 Expenses are from the 3CE and 2002 Plan respectively.  The co=
st-type breakdown requested is not available.
- The cash burn rate is net and ties to the change in the Enron Working Cap=
ital line balance by period. I do not have visibility to the gross outflows=
 due to format differences.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks.

Chris
