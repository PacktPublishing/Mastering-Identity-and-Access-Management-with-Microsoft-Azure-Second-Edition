Could we have a telephone call and discuss what our slides should look like=
 for this presentation.  I assume we will try to make the presentation for =
the respective pipelines look similar -  as much as possible.  Let me know =
when you are available.   I have time today from 1:00 to 2:00 and about 4:3=
0.  Tomorrow I am free most of the day. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I am working w=
ith Rod on this one.  LEts try Thursday afternoon?=20


I also would like to know if our timeline has changed  -( 9/22 with Stan an=
d 11/8 with Mr. Lay) [Geaccone, Tracy]  Do you mean 10/22.  I will put some=
thing out on this this afternoon.=20


Lastly, is there an expectation for the Quarter Forecast?  Right now, NNG C=
ommercial is showing a September upside as well as an October upside.  We p=
lan to offset all but $500,000 in the November / December time frame.   Whi=
le we would be up for the period from Sept-Dec by the $500,000, we would be=
 down for the fourth quarter. [Geaccone, Tracy]    Are you sure you are rea=
dy to commit to this.  Can you make it up?=20

Thanks
