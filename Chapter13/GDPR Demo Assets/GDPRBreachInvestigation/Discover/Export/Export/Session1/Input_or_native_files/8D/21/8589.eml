Recently, Enron Corp received a request from the U.S. Environmental Protect=
ion Agency (EPA) to provide information relating to any spill, discharge, o=
r release of "oil" (broadly defined but excludes natural gas or liquid petr=
oleum gas) from any EOTT pipeline facility for the time period from July 1,=
 1998 to July 7, 2001. A "pipeline facility" includes those fleet operation=
s where tanks are connected by/to pipelines or to other tanks through pipin=
g and in which any EOTT entity owns an interest. The EPA request seeks deta=
iled information concerning releases of "oil" during this period, including=
 among other things, the extent and nature of the spill, which EOTT or EPSC=
 representative/employee was the first to learn of the spill, remedial effo=
rts, weather conditions at the release site, etc. The request also seeks in=
formation concerning pipeline management system(s) in place during this thr=
ee-year period and efforts or investments made by EOTT to prevent the relea=
se of "oil," including capital costs, expenditures and maintenance costs.=20

In order to respond to the EPA information request, you are instructed to i=
dentify and locate any relevant documents or information and ensure that no=
 responsive information or documents are destroyed or discarded. You may be=
 contacted about this inquiry in the near future, because we will be sendin=
g teams to many of the field locations to assist employees in identifying a=
nd locating documents responsive to the EPA's information request. If you b=
elieve you have relevant information or responsive documents but have not b=
een contacted/visited by one of our teams by August 17, 2001, please contac=
t the designated document custodian, Don Hawkins (713-646-7358).

Due to the length of the EPA information request, we have not attached the =
document here. However, if you would like a copy, have any questions concer=
ning the scope or nature of the request, or have any questions regarding th=
e document collection process, please contact Lou Soldano (713-853-7237) or=
 Dave Nutt (713-853-7267).=20

Thank you for your cooperation.
