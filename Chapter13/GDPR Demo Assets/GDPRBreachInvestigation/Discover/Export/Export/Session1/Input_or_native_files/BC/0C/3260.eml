No problem on the reschedule. What about Thursday, Nov. 1?  Actually, Jacki=
e is going to stay with her friend Claire.  But, Garret is very excited abo=
ut staying with Jake.  Will that be ok?

Can we reschedule our glass of wine? I have been burning the candle at both=
 ends and starting early and working late every night. We are still on for =
Saturday with the kids. Let me know when you want to bring them over. Also,=
 lets pick a day next week for that glass of wine.
