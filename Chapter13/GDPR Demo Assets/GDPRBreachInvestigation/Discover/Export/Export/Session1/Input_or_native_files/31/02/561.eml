We have several cost centers in Tax that wish to allocate to Clean Fuels.  =
How do you want us to handle these assuming that they should not go to EOTT=
?

Dawn:  Only assets were sold to EOTT.  The legal entities still remain with=

Our understanding is that Clean Fuels has been sold to EOTT and so I includ=
ed the Clean Fuels allocation in with EOTT's number.

Dawn:  Laura Mattox of EOTT called inquiring about her tax charge(CC14502) =
of $79,000 which is 3 times more than last year.  My records show a charge =
of $49,000 to EOTT.  Can you help me explain the $30,000 difference?

Thanks,=20
