Attached is the revised calendar for the completion of the 2002 Plan.  As y=
ou will note, the dates have been moved up approximately 2 weeks in most ca=
ses.  This is a result of the recent management changes and executive avail=
ability.

A couple of notes on the dates:

-Please note that dates for assessments apply to ALL BUSINESS UNITS who wil=
l be senders of costs.
-The October 18th due date for the Presentation Pages: I will provide more =
information at a later date on this.
-The dates highlighted in yellow are not 2002 Plan related, but merely a re=
minder of other significant items that will be occurring in this time frame=
.

Also included in the file FYI is the PROPOSED schedule for the Plan/Executi=
ve Business Reviews with the Office of the Chairman.  These are still subje=
ct to change.  Rick Causey's office (Sharron Westbrook) is coordinating the=
 schedules of the applicable attendees.  I will let you know when these are=
 final.

Additionally, the Plan will be submitted to Corporate in the traditional fo=
rmat, Excel files.  We will be sending the templates out on (or by) Septemb=
er 20, as reflected in the revised calendar.  However, our strategy is stil=
l to enter 2002 with the full plan ( I/S, B/S, Cash Flow) loaded into Adayt=
um and to utilize Adaytum going forward from that point.  Therefore, we wil=
l be enhancing the Excel files to include the level of detail that will be =
loaded into Adaytum, so there will be additional lines and/or supplemental =
schedules added to the files.

One more thing - please communicate all of this information to the appropri=
ate individuals in your business unit/group.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Steve
