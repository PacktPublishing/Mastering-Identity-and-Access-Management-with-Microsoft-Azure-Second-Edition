Property tax liability, in a given tax year i.e. 2002, is directly related =
to the level of income and asset cost of the prior calendar year i.e. 2001.=
  As in the case of NNG & TW, income and asset cost are increasing. Therefo=
re, property taxes also will increase.

In order to keep the property tax liability flat, three strategies are avai=
lable (1) book any gain on the sale of an asset below the line (N.U.O.I.), =
(2) assets there are no longer in service should be retired from the books =
of records, and (3) items that can be expensed should be expensed and not c=
apitalized to plant, property, & equipment.

If you have any other questions or comments, please advise.

The 2002 Plan reflects an annual property tax accrual increase for both com=
panies of approximately $1.0 MM (NNG $.3 MM and TW $.7 MM) above what is pr=
esently being accrued on each company this year. Would you please respond t=
o Tracy on the reasons for the increase between years and also provide a po=
ssible strategy for keeping the accrual flat. She will need your response b=
y Friday to cover any question/concerns Stan may have after his review this=
 weekend. Thanks in advance for your cooperation and support. =20
