Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
. =20
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late=
=20
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time =
to=20
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie.=20
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
 =20
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your=
=20
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland,=20
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John
