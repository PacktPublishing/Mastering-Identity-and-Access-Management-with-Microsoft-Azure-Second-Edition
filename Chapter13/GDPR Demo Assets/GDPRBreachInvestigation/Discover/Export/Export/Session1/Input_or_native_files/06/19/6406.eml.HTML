Well, the stock price is down $1 and some change because of the 3Q 10Q. &nbsp;I went over the 4Q numbers with Stan. &nbsp;He was ok with them. &nbsp;I am either sitting in for him or accompanying him to the Whalley meeting today. &nbsp;Enron announced they are going to have layoffs next week. &nbsp;I am sure you have seen the e-mail. &nbsp;The office is quiet. &nbsp;How are things going up there? &nbsp;Are you leaving this afternoon?
