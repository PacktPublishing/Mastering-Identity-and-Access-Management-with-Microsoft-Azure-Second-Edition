Tracy,
<br>
<br>I'm sure you have no time for this now, but I wanted to get this information to you as soon as I had it. &nbsp;I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget. &nbsp;(A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.) &nbsp;It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities. &nbsp;Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan? &nbsp;(I have not broached this with Stan.) &nbsp;I've attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget. &nbsp;When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>
<br>John
<br>

<br>Have the Steve Kean numbers been included in his budget and allocated out for 2002?
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>Tracy,
<br>
<br>Thank you! &nbsp;These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business. &nbsp;I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor. &nbsp;However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget. &nbsp;I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers. &nbsp;Please let me know when you need details.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>
<br>John
