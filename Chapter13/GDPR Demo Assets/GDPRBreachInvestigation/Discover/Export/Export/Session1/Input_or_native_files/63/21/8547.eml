eSource is based on your current year usage as a percentage of total curren=
t year usage.  The amount is simply a guideline and charges will only be in=
curred if you use eSource in 2002.

The additional amount for IT Infrastructure relates to a passthrough to Oth=
er Business Units of Infrastructure charges allocated to ENA from ENW.  The=
 basis for this is a calculation of FTE's based on 2002 Planned allocations=
 from ENA support departments to your business unit.  You are then charged =
a % of that support department's Infrastructure charges applicable to the F=
TE's.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Edie=20
