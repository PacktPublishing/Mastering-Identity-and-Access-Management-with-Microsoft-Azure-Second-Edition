<br>Mark,
<br>
<br>In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE. &nbsp;It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE &nbsp;( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East. &nbsp;&nbsp;This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr. &nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.
<br>
<br>Sommers &nbsp;
