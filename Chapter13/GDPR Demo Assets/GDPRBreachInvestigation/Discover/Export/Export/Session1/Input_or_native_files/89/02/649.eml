Messers Walters, Zahn, and McEllin are going to go back thru yr end audit w=
orkpaper files and pull those that (hopefully) support
balances or year to year variations for each line item of the audited incom=
e statement and balance sheet, and selected cash flow items. They will star=
t w 2000vs1999 and work back from there. We intend to have an initial "pack=
age" within a week. =20

I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully=
 able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin t=
o add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quit=
e possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as po=
ssible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do t=
his again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it =
does need to get complete this year.
