<br>I think you may be reading more into this than was meant by the memo. &nbsp;There are alot of business entities that roll-up into EGS. &nbsp;There usually is some flexibility in each business unit regarding their quarterly numbers. &nbsp;By having all the facts we as a team can present them to Causey. &nbsp;We may very well be able to accelerate earnings in one group for a quarter to make up deficiencies in another group. &nbsp;It would be nice to be able to discuss these options as a unit before reporting them to corporate. &nbsp;No one is trying to manage anything other than to give Rick a complete assessment as to what EGS results look like and the fexibility we have as a unit. &nbsp;This is all Tracy was trying to convey. &nbsp;No one has asked that you not respond to corporate only that we have a chance to see what our numbers look like as an entity before releasing to corporate. &nbsp;I don't think Rick has any problem with this but I will ask Rod by this memo to check with Rick to see if he does.
<br> 
<br>I think this is pretty consistent with the way wholesale and retail report to corporate.
<br> 
<br>Thanks.

<br>I would like to discuss the below message when you have a chance. &nbsp;There has been a lot of distrust and concern over &quot;managed information&quot; with respect to the international assets. &nbsp;My team has overcome this by going out of our way to cooperate and be transparent with corp the last year and a half. &nbsp;I am uncomfortable asking my people not to respond to corp requests for information. &nbsp;I also think the tone of the message is demeaning and could have a morale impact on my folks.

<br>Please make sure your numbers go through me or Stan before we give them to Corp. Corp's request for these things should be coming through me in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rod and I are meeting with Stan on Monday, October 22. &nbsp;We would like to discuss your 4th Q numbers then if possible.
<br>
<br>Let me know. 
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>Mark, 
<br>
<br>In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE. &nbsp;It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE &nbsp;( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East. &nbsp;&nbsp;This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr. &nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.
