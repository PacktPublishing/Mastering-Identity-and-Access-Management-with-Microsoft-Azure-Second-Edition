<br>Scott,
<br>
<br>As discussed yesterday we really appreciate your help in moving the negotiations along for the Master with Williams Energy Marketing &amp; Trading Company.
<br>
<br>Just to give you some facts:
<br>We do have a GISB with Williams, of which they are the Confirming Party. Williams has made a decision not to confirm any deals less than a month in term, this is breach of contract. We currently have over 800 deals pending execution as they are not sending paper. 
<br>
<br>We have been unsuccessful for several months and the hold-up seems to be with Williams Legal group. Their Credit group is in favor of this Master as I understand it.
<br>Below are the several people we have been in contact with over the last several months.
<br>
<br>Credit: Trey Skelton @ 918-573-5662 and Tim Neuman @ 918-573-4880
<br>Legal: &nbsp;Kelly Knowlton @ 918-573-5278
<br>
<br>Debra Perlingiere in ENA Legal is handling the negotiations on our side and can be reached at 713-853-7658.
<br>If you have any questions, please call me x54099.
<br>Many thanks for your help !
<br>Best Regards
<br>Ellen
