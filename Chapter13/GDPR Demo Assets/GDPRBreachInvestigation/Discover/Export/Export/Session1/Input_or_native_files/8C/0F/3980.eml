Attached is a file that Cheryl and I developed concerning the Corporate MMF=
 and Direct Charges budget that we have received to date.  We have to send =
out a partnership budget on Monday, October 1 and would like to get a good =
handle on which of these charges will be eliminated or reduced substantiall=
y at the Friday meeting.  Since we are unsure of the benefit that many of t=
hese charges provide to us, it is doubtful that the partnership would appro=
ve all of these increases so we don't want to send out a budget that has th=
em in it. =20

It is our understanding that you want our questions directed to your group =
so that you can address corporate planning yourselves.  Please let us know =
if you need any additional clarification about our questions. =20
