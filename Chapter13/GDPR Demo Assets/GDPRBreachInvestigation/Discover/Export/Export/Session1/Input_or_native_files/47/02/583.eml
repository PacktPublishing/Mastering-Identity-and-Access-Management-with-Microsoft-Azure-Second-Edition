	For 2002 Plan please provide the following and we will incorporate into th=
e "base depreciation" and provide a

 to us yet but if this data is provided
	to us along with the C.E. or shortly thereafter we will be able to provide=
 plan projections immediately after the
	August close.  If you need this sooner then we must get this project data =
along with the C.E. data.
		Projects In service in 2002
