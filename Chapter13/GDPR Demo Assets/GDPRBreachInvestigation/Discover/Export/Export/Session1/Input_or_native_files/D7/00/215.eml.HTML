<body>
Scott,
<br>Thanks for taking the taking the time to talk with me. &nbsp;I am following up 
<br>with some additional information as I understand that you are representing me 
<br>in the PRC process.
<br>
<br>My Associate rotatation program &nbsp;(24 months) ended on June 15, 2000. 
<br>
<br>My third rotation was with Enron North America &nbsp;with Tim Detmering (X 36973) 
<br>which completed on March 1. &nbsp;Then I rotated to EBS and worked with James Row 
<br>(X58080) before joining Boris Brevnov permanently. &nbsp;Boris Brevnov (5-7795) is 
<br>nominating me for the Manager position in his group.
<br>
<br>Please do not hesitate to call them for any feedback on my performance.
<br>Thanks again.
<br>
