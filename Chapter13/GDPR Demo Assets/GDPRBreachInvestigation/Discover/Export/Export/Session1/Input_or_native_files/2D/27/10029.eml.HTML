I need ten minutes of your time to review the discussion database concept 
<br>that was requested by Frank Vickers back in Febuary. &nbsp;The purpose of the 
<br>meeting is to discuss the merits of the project, make a decision on whether 
<br>we move forward and if we do move forward whose budget this would impact.. &nbsp;
<br>Find attached a description of the project with a cost estimate ($10,560).
<br>I have scheduled EB3259 at 5:00PM 4/24/01, if you cannot make it please let 
<br>me know.
<br>Thanks,
<br>Sean
