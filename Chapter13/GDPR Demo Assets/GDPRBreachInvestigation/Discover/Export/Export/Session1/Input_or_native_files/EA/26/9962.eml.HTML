Because TW owns most of the existing facilities and NNG owns only a tap valve. &nbsp;TW should own all of the new facilities, but the NNG tap valve. &nbsp;This way the new and old installation will accommodate the abandonment that is planned for next year at the existing site. &nbsp;We had worked this through the law group earlier that TW would own. &nbsp;I believe Drew, Dari and Dorothy McCoppin were involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>I would suggest that Northern pay 100% and get reimbursed by TW so that NNG doesn't have to post the CIAC as TW does not have this requirement. &nbsp;The cost should be split as both parties benefit from the project. I assume the split has been agreed to by both Harris and Neubauer. &nbsp;MK &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>Steve Harris has asked for a CIAC for 50% of TW's construction costs on the Gray County interconnect. &nbsp;I assume that this must be posted on the bulletin board the same as any other CIAC. &nbsp;Is this correct? &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Also, the economics are based on NNG revenues covering both TW's and NNG's capital expenditure. &nbsp;For recovery purposes wouldn't it be better for NNG to reimburse TW 100% of its costs? &nbsp;Other wise isn't there a miss-match in that the volumes will be reflected in NNG's rate design with 50% of the cost of service residing on TW's books? &nbsp;

<br>I had a meeting with Steve Harris this afternoon. &nbsp;We would like to receive reimbursement of half of the capital expenditures for the Gray County Interconnect in 2001. &nbsp;This will be done as a CIAC. &nbsp;Any tax gross up will wash at an ETS level. &nbsp;Please let me know when we can expect payment.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks
<br>
<br>Tracy
