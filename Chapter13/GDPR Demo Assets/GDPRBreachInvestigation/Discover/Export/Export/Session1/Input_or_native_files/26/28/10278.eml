Thanks for meeting this morning and developing a plan that that will accomm=
odate the needs of the different groups within ETS.  As we begin to use Ada=
ytum I believe we will see other areas where it will benefit ETS and EGS as=
 well as opportunities for enhancements within our existing models.

Thanks again.

Tracy,

I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the rema=
ining ETS modeling and development.  Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday an=
d will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year.  He will be respons=
ible for the completion of the O&M model for home office.  He will also be =
responsible for the Marketing initiative. =20

I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs.  They will require a re=
source for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&M contributo=
r model.  If they should decide to move forward with development of a full =
financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a mi=
nimum.  We will scope their financial system requirements during the initia=
l two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will =
be.

As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of =
January.  I will address the remain issues with Operations.  I address data=
 transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse.  I will assist wit=
h and manage all of the above initiatives.

Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.

Thanks
Hoang Vo
