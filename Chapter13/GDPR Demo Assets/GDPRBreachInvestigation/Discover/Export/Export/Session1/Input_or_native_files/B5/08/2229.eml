Tracy,

I have reconciled the detail file on these and no other ETS company is pick=
ing up the costs.  I will be sending a detailed list of the companies to re=
ceive restricted stock with the final allocations on Wednesday.

These companies have 200-300 people on them each, I hope no other ETS compa=
ny is picking up their share!  Please let me know.

Thanks
Tracy

Elaine,
This is the response we received from Corp. on allocations to 1202 and 1195=
.


Mary,=20

Other than possibly benefit items, we won't allocate to those companies ind=
ividually.  I am getting a copy of the Restricted stock allocations and the=
y may have some charges to these companies.  I suspect that any charges to =
these two are in the ETS-HQ line but will work with Sharon Aulds to confirm=
. =20

Check with Dawn on these companies.  If they don't have employees, the prob=
ably won't have Corp Charges.

None of my companies (1202, 42P, 1195, 184) are listed in this spreadsheet.=
  What do I need to include in my Function?  Are you going to send me a por=
tion of the ETS HQ?  It may make more sense to take those straight to the p=
ipelines rather that flow them through 1202.  Please let me know what you w=
ant to do.

Thanks,  Elaine

Attached is the revised Corporate Allocation worksheet.  Corporate cost cen=

We do not expect significant changes to the allocations, and any additional=
 changes will be communicated to you for inclusion in your business unit's =
plan.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
