Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and Le=
onidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire t=
o have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would=20
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in=
 Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your =
reference.

thanks,

Scott
