Tracy,
As Michael already told you, I am working on a valutation project for Rod, =
and was hoping to get cash flow (projections) for Northern Nautral and Tran=
swestern. If you have info for EOTT also, that would be great. Otherwise, c=
an you direct me where to get the info?
Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have.

Thanks,

JB
