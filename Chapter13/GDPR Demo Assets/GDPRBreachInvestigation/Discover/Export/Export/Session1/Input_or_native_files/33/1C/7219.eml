Mark,

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2n=
d CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferre=
d out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Me=
rchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This=
 does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe=
 to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will =
send you those numbers when we are done.

Sommers =20
