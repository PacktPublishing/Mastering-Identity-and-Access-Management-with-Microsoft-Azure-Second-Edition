<br>
<br>Hello everyone.
<br>
<br>In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility. &nbsp;
<br>Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
<br>June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)). &nbsp;I think it's time to 
<br>go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 
<br>
<br>I would like suggestions as to:
<br>
<br>1) &nbsp;Where to go.
<br>
<br>2) &nbsp;What should be the focus of the business meetings.
<br>
<br>3) &nbsp;Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
<br>climb a mountain)? &nbsp;I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 
<br>
<br>4) &nbsp;And any other ideas you have.
<br>
<br>In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month. &nbsp;
<br>The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m. &nbsp;Please add this to your 
<br>schedule. &nbsp;I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility. &nbsp;Portland, 
<br>Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Regards
<br>
<br>John
