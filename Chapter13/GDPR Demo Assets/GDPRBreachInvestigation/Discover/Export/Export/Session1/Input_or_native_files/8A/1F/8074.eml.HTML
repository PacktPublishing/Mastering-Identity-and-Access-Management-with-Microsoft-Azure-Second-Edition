Scott,
<br>
<br>Please see the message below from Neil Davies. &nbsp;Neil works in HR under David 
<br>Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night. &nbsp;I asked him not to 
<br>mention the dinner with you. &nbsp;A problem that is coming up is that the 
<br>interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been 
<br>pushed to the end of that line is Hunter. &nbsp;What are your thoughts on this and 
<br>is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all? &nbsp;If you need 
<br>me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be 
<br>happy to help.
<br>
<br>Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him. &nbsp;Eddie does not want 
<br>to come in any earlier than 4. &nbsp;That can be a problem. &nbsp;Maybe another thought 
<br>is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may 
<br>be tough to get him back.
<br>
<br>Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back 
<br>from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.
<br>
<br>Kim

<br>Just called - can come in on Weds 23rd ( reason why he can't come in earlier 
<br>- vacation from 16th to 19th ) . Still interested in talking - simply a 
<br>scheduling issue - don't seem to be any barriers to moving forward.
<br>
<br>They have just moved office - hence new number (7139890962)
<br>
<br>Does the 23rd work ?
<br>
<br>I didn't mention the Scott Neal call.
<br>
<br>Neil
