EPPI Claim for 2000-2001

Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agree=
ment committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation r=
ates above 4.45%.  NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are someti=
mes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for=
 transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.

The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final =
determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPP=
I commitment.


Prior Claim (1997-1999)

On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I check=
ed the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.

During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the=
 prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made. =20
