As stated on the revised 2002 Plan Key Dates calendar, Friday, September 7 =
was the day preliminary allocations were due to any business unit which wil=
l be recieving allocations from your business unit.  If you have not yet co=
mmunicated the amounts with the BUs who will be a receiver of costs from yo=
ur BU, this is a freindly suggestion that you may want to at least touch ba=
se with the receiver BUs.  Since targets are to scheduled to be communicate=
d this week and some groups have already begun to build their Plan, it is i=
mportant that some additional unexpected allocated costs aren't a surprise =
at the last minute.  Some business units may interpret not hearing anything=
 from another business unit as no allocations are forthcoming.  This week i=
s important to the overall planning process, since questions and clarificat=
ions regarding allocations should be taking place this in order to facilita=
te the allocations being finalized by the 14th (the end of this week).=20
Thanks,
Steve


PS - If you have already sent your allocations out, please disregard.
