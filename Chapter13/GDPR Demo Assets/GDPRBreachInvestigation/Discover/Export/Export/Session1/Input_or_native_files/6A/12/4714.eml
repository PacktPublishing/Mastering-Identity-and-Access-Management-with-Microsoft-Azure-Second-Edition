Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal (2/2=
010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and loca=
tions will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you have=
 made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge dea=
l.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  So=
rry for the trouble.
