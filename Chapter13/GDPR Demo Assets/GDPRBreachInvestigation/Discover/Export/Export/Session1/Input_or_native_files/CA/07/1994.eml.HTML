Tracy,
<br>
<br>I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the remaining ETS modeling and development. &nbsp;Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday and will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year. &nbsp;He will be responsible for the completion of the O&amp;M model for home office. &nbsp;He will also be responsible for the Marketing initiative. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs. &nbsp;They will require a resource for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&amp;M contributor model. &nbsp;If they should decide to move forward with development of a full financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a minimum. &nbsp;We will scope their financial system requirements during the initial two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will be.
<br>
<br>As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of January. &nbsp;I will address the remain issues with Operations. &nbsp;I address data transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse. &nbsp;I will assist with and manage all of the above initiatives.
<br>
<br>Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.
<br>
<br>Thanks
<br>Hoang Vo
