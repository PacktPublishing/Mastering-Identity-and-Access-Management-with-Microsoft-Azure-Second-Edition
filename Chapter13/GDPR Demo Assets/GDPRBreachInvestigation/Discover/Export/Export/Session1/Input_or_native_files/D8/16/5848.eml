Can you help explain how the data in the attached file matches the detailed=
 budgets and current estimates you have provided to me?    It may simply, I=
 just haven't had time to look.



Rod,

Thanks for the email.  Can you help me match the information in this email
to your operating plan or cash flow analysis?
