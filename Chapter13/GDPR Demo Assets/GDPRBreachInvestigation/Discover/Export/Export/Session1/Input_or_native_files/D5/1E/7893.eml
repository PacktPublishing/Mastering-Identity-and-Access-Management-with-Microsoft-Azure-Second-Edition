On tuesday of this week after EOTT's staff meeting, I was made aware of a p=
otential environmental estimate problem (too big).    I am looking at ways =
of potentially dealing with the problem so that Lawrence will feel comforta=
ble not booking a reserve in the 3rd qtr, which may have consequences on th=
e plans we have underway to recapitalize the entity.   This means coming up=
 with an answer very quickly.   There are a number of potential alternative=
s and I am sure there are more than I will attempt to lay out here.

1) We could simply make a contribution to EOTT for the sole purpose of envi=
ronmental cleanup, and if unused will be returned.   Seems like an expense =
item, but doable.

2) We could provide an insurance policy to EOTT to provide for environmenta=
l expenses in excess of the existing policy, for a fee.    Better expense t=
reatment (we get to manage the reserve) and appears to cover the EOTT issue=
.   Because this is an affiliated deal, I guess it would have to go through=
 the audit committee.   Potentially the captive could be used.

3) Provide an accounting answer that might give EOTT a one-time gain to off=
set the one time reserve set-up.   i.e., there is a least an argument that =
the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portio=
n of the debt on the books represented by the API's.     Since we are getti=
ng a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal, this should be doabl=
e.

For Lawrence:  Jim Bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may =
have merit, and so I will need some input from you regarding the coverage t=
hat exists now and what we would want going forward.    If you want us to t=
alk directly with Susan, we will.   I am thinking that you are getting a qu=
ote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give yo=
u the same deal, or maybe even slightly better, to satisfy the audit commit=
tee. =20

I am obviously looking for any help that I can get here, so if there any mo=
re ideas I would like to hear them.    If you have questions, feel free to =
ask.    Stan is aware of what we are discussing.   1) and 3) were his reque=
sts to review.
