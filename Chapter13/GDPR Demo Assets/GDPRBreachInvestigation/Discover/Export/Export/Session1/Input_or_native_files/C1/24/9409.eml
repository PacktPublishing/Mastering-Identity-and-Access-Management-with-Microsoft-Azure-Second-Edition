FYI - If this request is approved, the reclassification/reporting of AFUDC =
Equity within Other Income-Other should result in an additional $700K to IB=
IT for 2001 (NNG $500K, TW $200K).

Request to remap the below two SAP accounts for AFUDC equity from hyperion =
account 1755 (Other Deduction-Interest Capitalized)
to hyperion 1690 (Other Income -Other)               Effective: for SEPTEMB=
ER 2001 Close.

     SAP Accounts      Description                             From: Curren=
t Mapping              To: New Mapping
          59900900     AFUDC Equity Settlement                1755_59900900=
                     1690_59900900
          69010000     AFUDC Equity                                 1755_69=
010000                     1690_69010000

AFUDC equity (SAP accounts 59900900-AFUDC equity settlement and 69010000-AF=
UDC equity) map to Hyperion 1755-interest capitalized.  The only companies =
using these two SAP accounts as of July and the YTD credit balances in each=
 of them are companies 141-$531,155, 179-$328,270, 413-$12,681 (debit), 536=
-$3,066,408, 60-$91,391 and 62-$290,438.

In conclusion I have reviewed the proposed remapping with representatives o=
f the various ETS companies and they confirmed the remapping would not pres=
ent any problems to them.

PS.   Pls notify me or Hoyt Ivey when change is made in Corp Hyperion so he=
 can remap same accounts in EOC hyperion.=20
