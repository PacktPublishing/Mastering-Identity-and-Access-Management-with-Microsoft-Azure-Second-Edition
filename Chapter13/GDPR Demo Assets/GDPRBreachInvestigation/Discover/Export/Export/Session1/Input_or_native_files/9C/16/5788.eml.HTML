<br>
<br>Rod,
<br>
<br>Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you? &nbsp;Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.
<br>
<br>Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock). &nbsp;I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above. &nbsp;If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true. &nbsp;Let me know.
<br>
<br>Thanks
<br>Sarah
