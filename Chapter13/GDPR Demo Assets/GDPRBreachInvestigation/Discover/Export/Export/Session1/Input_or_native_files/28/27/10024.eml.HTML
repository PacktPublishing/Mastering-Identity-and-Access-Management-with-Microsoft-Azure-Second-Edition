<br>
<br>In delaying implementation until COB Wednesday, I was trying to get past AGA ,
<br>s announcements. &nbsp;I ,ve been told that they may not be able to liquidate 
<br>immediately after AGA ,s are released. &nbsp;(If market collapses, then buying 
<br>shorts would be easy, however if market rallies, the impression is that they 
<br>may want to sell into the rally.)
<br>
<br>The short version is that they like their positions.
<br>

<br>
<br>Immediate desk head feedback has been to delay these factors, perhaps 
<br>implementing over the weekend.

<br>Importance: High
<br>
<br>Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening. &nbsp;
<br>Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below. &nbsp;
<br>Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical 
<br>risk. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
<br>Let me know if you need access to component VAR analysis, so that you can 
<br>effectively manage VAR. &nbsp;
