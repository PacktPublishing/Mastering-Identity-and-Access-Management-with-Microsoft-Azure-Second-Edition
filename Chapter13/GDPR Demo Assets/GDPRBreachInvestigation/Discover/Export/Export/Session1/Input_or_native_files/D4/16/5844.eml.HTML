Attached is a revised version of the capital charge presentation. &nbsp;Several clarifications have been made based on issues raised by various business units. One of the more significate is that Cummulative Translation Adjustment will be excluded from Equity. 
<br>
<br>Cash flow will now include the change in all intercompany balance sheet account - Hyperion lines 0051, 0052, 0037, 0038, 0218, 0486, 0516, 0517, 0660, 0661, 0878, 0901, 0915, 0936 and 0941. &nbsp;This should simplify the cash flow when cash transfers are made between companies and when intercompany dividends and contributions are made.
<br>
<br>Steve Schwarzbach is working on the template to calculate the capital charge for the restated plan. &nbsp;He will be sending this out on Tuesday. &nbsp;I have added a slide with the Hyperion lines that I think are need in calculating the Total Capital. &nbsp;Please let me know if I have missed anything.
<br>
<br>Please let me know if you have any questions, issues, etc. &nbsp;
