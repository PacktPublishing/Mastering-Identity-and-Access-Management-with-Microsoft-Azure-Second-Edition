<br>Thank you for your participation in the phone screen process. &nbsp;

<br>
<br>Guys,
<br>
<br>You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round. &nbsp;Each &nbsp;candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates. &nbsp;&nbsp;(these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders). &nbsp;
<br>
<br>As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this. &nbsp;The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.
<br>
<br>Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>
<br> Karen.
