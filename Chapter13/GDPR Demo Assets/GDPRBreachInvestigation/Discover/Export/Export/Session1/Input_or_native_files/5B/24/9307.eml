This is calculated using, form the NBP 2000 10-K:
Net income+ minority interest in net income + interest expense, net - equit=
y AFUDC.

	$196.0 million

This is not a number we generally use.  We always include EBITDA in our pre=
ss releases.  Just FYI, EBITDA for 2000 was $259.0 million and, in addition=
 to the above, is adjusted by depreciation and amortization and goodwill am=
ortization
