<br>Per our conversation earlier this week, EOTT's projection for 2002 Net Income is $26.9 million. &nbsp;My understanding is that this is all that will be required from us in connection with the 2002 Plan process at Enron. &nbsp;Please advise if this is not correct.. &nbsp;I'll be out of the office next week. &nbsp;If anything further is required, during that time, please contact John as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>Given the internet problems we've had lately, please acknowledge receipt of this email by sending me a reply. &nbsp;Thanks
<br>Karl
