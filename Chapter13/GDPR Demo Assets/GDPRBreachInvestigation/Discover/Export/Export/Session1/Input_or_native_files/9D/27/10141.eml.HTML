We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract 
<br>later this month. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've been screening outside resumes but internally we 
<br>haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already 
<br>at Enron. &nbsp;If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley. &nbsp;
<br>If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and 
<br>associates arrive and do a session then.
