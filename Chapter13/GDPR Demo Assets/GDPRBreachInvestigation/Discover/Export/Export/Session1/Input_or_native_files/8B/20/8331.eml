I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million=
 UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not =
defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the dir=
ective, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in Octobe=
r of $1.2 million. =20

Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include =
the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

Thanks
