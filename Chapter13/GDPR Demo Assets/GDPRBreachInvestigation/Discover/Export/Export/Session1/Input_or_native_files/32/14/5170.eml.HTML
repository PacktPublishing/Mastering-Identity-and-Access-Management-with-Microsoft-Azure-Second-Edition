<br>EREC 53.2
<br>Azurix (not including Marlin) (5.2)
<br>Clean Fuels (21.1) &nbsp;I need to double check this one this morning.

<br>We talked about EGAS yesterday. &nbsp;Its their 2nd CE plus ( in this case minus) the assets we have picked up. &nbsp;We will review updated 4Q with Stan on Tuesday afternoon.
<br>
<br>I will have to check with EEOS unless you already have.
