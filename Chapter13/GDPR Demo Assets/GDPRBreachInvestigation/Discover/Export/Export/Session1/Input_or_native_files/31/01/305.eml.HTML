<br>Tracy, &nbsp;We will be increasing NNG Operations Capital Current Estimate by $4.0MM with the forecast coming up to cover the additional Cooper Pre-Buy Standby. &nbsp;Morris indicated that there was a pot of Capital dollars somewhere in ETS that can be reduced so that we don't increase the total ETS Capital Budget. &nbsp;Can you confirm this?
<br>
<br>Thanks, &nbsp;Elaine

<br>I spoke with Morris, and we will increase NNG Operations for the $4.0MM and request that it be offset elsewhere within ETS. &nbsp;I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level. &nbsp;We will need to work with Tracy on this.
<br>
<br>If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know. 
<br>
<br>Thanks, &nbsp;Elaine

<br>We're talking about $4.0m for 2001. Should I go ahead &amp; increase our Curr Est to be sent out this week? &nbsp;Diane

<br>As far as I know, we are to adjust our C/E up for the amount of the pre-by bookings.

<br>
<br>$1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory. &nbsp;According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year. &nbsp;How are these dollars to be funded? &nbsp;I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.
<br>
<br>If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.
<br>
<br>Thanks!
