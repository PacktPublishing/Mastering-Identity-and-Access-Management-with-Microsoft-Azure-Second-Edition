Tracy, it looks like it is because of the estimate we used for the July cash
<br>flow. I will keep looking at this and see if I can come up with a specific
<br>item that caused this.

<br>Sorry Tracy, I can't come up with the reason behind the July change of $11 
<br>million in &quot;Other, Net&quot;. Carolyn who completes the schedules had surgery 
<br>yesterday so will be out until Sept. 11. I can't find the source of the 
<br>amount that is hardcoded in the spreadsheet - she must have combined 
<br>something. One thought was TOLI, but it was flat in July. I have two other 
<br>people who might be able to help me on vacation this week as well.

<br>There was a big change in the Funds Flow number you submitted for the 3Q in 
<br>August from the 3Q you submitted last month. Can you tell me what the change 
<br>is due to? 
<br>
<br>Thanks 
<br>
<br>Tracy
