<br>
<br>Attached is a draft analysis of comparing revenues from different uses of some of the TW excess retained fuel for this year:
<br>
<br>Keep San Juan shippers whole and get imbalance gas back by year end
<br>
<br>Cut San Juan shippers deliveries and sell excess retained fuel right away
<br>
<br>A break even settled San Juan imbalance gas cash out price is determined.
<br>
<br>If the settled cash out price is above $4.23/MMBtu, keeping the shippers whole is a better alternative.
<br>
<br>Please review and comment on the draft analysis and make sure that I didn't misinterpret the information provided by you.
<br>
<br>Thanks! &nbsp;
