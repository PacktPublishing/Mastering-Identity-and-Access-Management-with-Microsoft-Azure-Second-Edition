Subject:	Revised Capital Charge for 2001

Attached is an explanation of the revised capital charge that will be used =
for 2001.  It is substanially different from the methodology used in prior =
years and will be applied only on at the business unit level.

The 2001 Plan will be restated to include the revised capital charge.  The =
restated plan format file will be due on February 24.  We will send a templ=
ate for calculating the plan capital charge next week.

The actual capital charge for January will be booked in February business.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
