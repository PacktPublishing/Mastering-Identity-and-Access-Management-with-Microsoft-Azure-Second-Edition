Tracy:

Sorry to bother you with this one again -

in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base=
 gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million =
in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 200=
1 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expense=
s that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be =
a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!
