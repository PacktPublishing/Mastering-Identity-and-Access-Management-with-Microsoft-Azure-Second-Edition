The attached spreadsheet shows the quarterly reclasses between O&M and COGS=
 for Transwestern for the year 2000.  As we discussed, we are very supporti=
ve of making this 2000 reclass in order to avoid having to explain large ye=
ar to year variances caused only by the re-mapping. It will also conform En=
ron's reporting to TW's stand-alone GAAP reporting for 2000.  Please call i=
f you have any questions.

Thanks for helping us make this happen.
