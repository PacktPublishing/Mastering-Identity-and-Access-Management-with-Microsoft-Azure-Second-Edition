<br>Technical Tools of the Trade
<br>Have you ever watched a stock that seems to bounce around a lot, but 
<br>never really gets anywhere? You've probably found a stock that is 
<br>locked in a so-called trading range. Understanding the relationship 
<br>between support, resistance and trading ranges can help you spot when 
<br>a stock breaks out of the range and starts a new trend.
