Actually, we are working with each group to see why their charges are up an=
d we are trying to get them reduced.  We will discuss with Stan at our ETS =
review and do further follow up if necessary.  We actually met with Terry W=
est and Dawn Derr last week to get their input and contacts.

Tracy,
Jim had wanted to meet with the business heads that charges us thru the cor=
p charges to hear their business justifications and assumptions used in all=
ocating costs to us.  I just want to check if you are doing this with Stan.=
  If you are, then maybe Jim can just sit in the same meeting.  Please let =
me know.  Thank you.
