For all concerned: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will only have 2 hours to cover a wide range of topics and Tracy will be working with Stan on the time allotments and expected content. &nbsp;&nbsp;She will be getting back in touch with you after our more detailed reviews with Stan, scheduled for Oct 11th (PGE) and Oct 12th (ETS &amp; EREC) to begin to get the actual presentations set up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone believes they need some one else to attend this planned review meeting with Ken Lay for support or other purposes, please let me know.
