Attached is a file showing depreciation for NNG Commercial after excluding =
depreciation for the capital dollars associated with rate case settlement (=
lines 13-16).  The 2002 depreciation is calculated to be $4.379 million. =20

I think philosophically it s a good idea to track capital projects within N=
NG Commercial based on the life of the contracts used to justify the projec=
t.  I don't think Neubauer is quite there yet. =20

My concern is that we have developed an IBIT  target for 2002 by using a 20=
01 number that does not include depreciation.  It seems that we ought to of=
fset the 01 starting point by the amount of the 02 depreciation.  Lets talk=
 further with Rod.
