Stan,

In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to b=
ring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and we=
re concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas =
by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the s=
ystem by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination =
of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending October Balance		12 Bcf
Ending November Balance		13 Bcf
Ending December Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2=
.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month). =
 We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November tha=
t should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We =
are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do no=
t wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational st=
orage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (w=
hich may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week)=
 for November.

Kent
