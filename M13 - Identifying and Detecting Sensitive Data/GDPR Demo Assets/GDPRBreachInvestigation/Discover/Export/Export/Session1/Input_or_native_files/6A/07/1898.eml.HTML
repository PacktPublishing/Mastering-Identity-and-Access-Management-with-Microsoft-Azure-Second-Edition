He is interested in the technology track or the analyst program. Is there anyone you could introduce him to? I believe he specified this in his objectives on his resume. Thanks so much for your help! Why are you at work? I thought Enron shut down?????

<br> &nbsp;Ask him to look at Enron job postings to see if there is anything he is interested in.
<br> &nbsp;I will see what I can do.

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracy,
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is Cal's resume. We would appreciate any help you could give him. He is available to come by and meet anyone you would think appropriate in the intern process. Please advise us what we should do next. He is working up here to get some experience but very interested in any prospects you might have at Enron. Thanks, Tracy!
