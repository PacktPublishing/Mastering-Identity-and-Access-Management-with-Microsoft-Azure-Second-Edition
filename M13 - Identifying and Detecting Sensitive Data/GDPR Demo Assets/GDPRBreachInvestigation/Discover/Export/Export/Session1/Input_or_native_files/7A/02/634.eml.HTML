<br>
<br>Kelley,
<br>
<br>I am writing to you to follow up on our discussion last week regarding
<br>disclosure of counterparty names for price verification purposes.
<br>Can you give me the name and contact information for the person within
<br>your company that would work with us to put a Confidentiality Agreement
<br>in place.
<br>Jeff Hodge is our lawyer who will work on this for Enron. &nbsp;Jeff can
<br>contacted at 713 853-6911 or by email at jeffrey.t.hodge@enron.com.
<br>
<br>Thanks for you assistance.
<br>
<br>Scott Neal
