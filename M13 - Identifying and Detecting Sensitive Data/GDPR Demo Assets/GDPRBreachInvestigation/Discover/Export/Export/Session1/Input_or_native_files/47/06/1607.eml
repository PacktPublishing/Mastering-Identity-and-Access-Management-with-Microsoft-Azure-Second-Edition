Palu,

Two major items affected the cashflow since August:
1.)  Air permits have been delayed from August, 2001 to November, 2001.  Th=
e delay of the air permits impacts construction start dates and delays ship=
ment of material.  Major payments of material, equipment and construction h=
ave slipped into 2002 because of the air permit delays. =20
2.)  Our compressor vendor has had a few problems.  Their payments are tied=
 to progress.  Our current forecast represents their current payment schedu=
le, which has slipped  as their fabrication has been delayed.

Thanks,
Steve Kalmus

Steve,

The last forecast you sent the 2001 Red Rock cash flow was $40.7 million, t=
he current forecast is $23.4 million. Please explain the difference of $ 17=
.3 million. This affects the TW Maketing Capital Plan for 2002.
