Today (Monday) you should receive a packet of preread materials for the offsite September 20-21. &nbsp;Because a large part of this conference will involve working sessions to discuss objectives and priorities for Global Accounting, we have gathered this material to stimulate ideas and discussion. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>On Thursday, you will discuss in breakout groups what you think Global Accounting's top few priorities should be. &nbsp;You should be prepared to consider the following questions, with the ultimate goal of determining and presenting your group's opinion of what the top priorities should be:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are (or should be) our customers?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are their business requirements?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do they value?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How and how well are we providing value to our customers and to Enron?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What activities should we continue, start, or stop?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>If you don't receive your packet of preread materials by the end of the day Monday, please contact me at x36641. &nbsp;
