For those of you who have already let me know you will be there, thanks.
The rest of you better move fast because there is a limited amount of
sleeping space!

If you misunderstood, we will be staying over only Saturday night.  Rod and
I will meet you at the Starbucks in Town & Country Mall behind the Chevron
station at 8:30am on Saturday June 9th.  Once you pick up your latte, we
will caravan to the beach house and fuel up (beer) for the traditional dad'=
s
only beach football game.

Winners will dine on:
Smoked Cajun Sausage
Crab Stuffed Jalape=A4os
Barbacued Shish Kabobs in a spicy mustard sauce
Mixed vegetables, salad and garlic bread

Loosers will cook.

Sunday breakfast will also be provided.

Bring:
Lunch for Saturday (variability of arrival times precludes planning an
appropriate meal), I repeat Lunch for Saturday.
Snacks
Beer

Fishing supplies
Beach supplies
Cooler for the beer
Mosquito repellant
Sleeping gear
Sunglasses
And, did I mention beer?

Vamos a la playa, ?? oh, oh oh oh, oh ??.
