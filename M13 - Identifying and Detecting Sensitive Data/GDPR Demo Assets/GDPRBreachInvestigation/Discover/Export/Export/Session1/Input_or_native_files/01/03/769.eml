Tracy and James,

Elaine and Phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in th=
e plan review package for Stan's review next week.

=20
I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002=
.  Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not hea=
rd that from Stan.  The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM n=
et contribution.  The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG.  42P does=
 not have employees and they use NNG employees.  When they do that, NNg cha=
rges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P.  T=
herefore,  42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise.  Phil=
 feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0=
 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG.  James and I talked ab=
out this on the phone.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks!
Rositza
