Sorry for the late notice, but here's the info on September capital charge:

As was done for the 2Q flash in June, we will be using an estimate for the =
September Capital Charge.  However, unlike last time, we will rely on each =
of you to estimate your September (and Q3) capital charge, since we will be=
 truing up to actuals YTD in October.  Please send us (myself and Terry Wes=
t) what you will be incorporating into your flash.  If you have any questio=
ns, please give one of us a call.

Thanks,
Steve and Terry
