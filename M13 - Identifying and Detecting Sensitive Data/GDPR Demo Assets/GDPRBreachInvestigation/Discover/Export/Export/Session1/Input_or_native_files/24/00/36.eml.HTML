<br>Attached is a file showing depreciation for NNG Commercial after excluding depreciation for the capital dollars associated with rate case settlement (lines 13-16). &nbsp;The 2002 depreciation is calculated to be $4.379 million. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I think philosophically it s a good idea to track capital projects within NNG Commercial based on the life of the contracts used to justify the project. &nbsp;I don't think Neubauer is quite there yet. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>My concern is that we have developed an IBIT &nbsp;target for 2002 by using a 2001 number that does not include depreciation. &nbsp;It seems that we ought to offset the 01 starting point by the amount of the 02 depreciation. &nbsp;Lets talk further with Rod.
