My concern is that what we are discussing would require the expenditure of =
funds of an extra $500K this year in order to move about $700 K of income t=
o next year.    I would like to know what event in 2002 will allow us to cr=
eate the income.   I believe based upon the contract, that the event has al=
ready taken place.    If someone can explain to me how this makes sense, I =
would like to hear it. =20

to my knowledge...we kept the "status quo" for sept (third qt)...that is, i=
t "grew" by another $100,000.

from an acctg perspective we do have some flexibility to set the reserve at=
 a level deemed appropriate

I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million=
 UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not =
defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the dir=
ective, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in Octobe=
r of $1.2 million. =20

Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include =
the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

Thanks
