We will defer to Rates &amp; Certificates on this one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to be thinking about what each entity is getting for it's investment in the project. 
<br>
<br>And there should be no tax grossup since the taxable entity will not be paying tax on the transaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think the tariff reads that it can only be charged if in fact it will be paid.

<br>Steve Harris has asked for a CIAC for 50% of TW's construction costs on the Gray County interconnect. &nbsp;I assume that this must be posted on the bulletin board the same as any other CIAC. &nbsp;Is this correct? &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Also, the economics are based on NNG revenues covering both TW's and NNG's capital expenditure. &nbsp;For recovery purposes wouldn't it be better for NNG to reimburse TW 100% of its costs? &nbsp;Other wise isn't there a miss-match in that the volumes will be reflected in NNG's rate design with 50% of the cost of service residing on TW's books? &nbsp;

<br>I had a meeting with Steve Harris this afternoon. &nbsp;We would like to receive reimbursement of half of the capital expenditures for the Gray County Interconnect in 2001. &nbsp;This will be done as a CIAC. &nbsp;Any tax gross up will wash at an ETS level. &nbsp;Please let me know when we can expect payment.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks
<br>
<br>Tracy
