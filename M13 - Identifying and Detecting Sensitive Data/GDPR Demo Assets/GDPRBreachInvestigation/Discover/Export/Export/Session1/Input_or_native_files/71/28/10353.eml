Rod and crew,

In speaking with Jayshree, I think Mitch and Jeff would like to divide the =
information into categories i.e legal information (environmental disclosure=
s, etc.) regulatory information, financial/accounting (I think we have a lo=
t of this and I will try to get it organized), any relevant tax information=
, etc.  I know this is a lot but let me know what you think, who I should c=
oordinated with, etc.

Thanks
Sarah=20
