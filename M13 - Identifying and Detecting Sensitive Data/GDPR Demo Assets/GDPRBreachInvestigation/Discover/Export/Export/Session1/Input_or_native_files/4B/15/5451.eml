Because TW owns most of the existing facilities and NNG owns only a tap val=
ve.  TW should own all of the new facilities, but the NNG tap valve.  This =
way the new and old installation will accommodate the abandonment that is p=
lanned for next year at the existing site.  We had worked this through the =
law group earlier that TW would own.  I believe Drew, Dari and Dorothy McCo=
ppin were involved.  =09

I would suggest that Northern pay 100% and get reimbursed by TW so that NNG=
 doesn't have to post the CIAC as TW does not have this requirement.  The c=
ost should be split as both parties benefit from the project. I assume the =
split has been agreed to by both Harris and Neubauer.  MK  =20

Steve Harris has asked for a CIAC for 50% of TW's construction costs on the=
 Gray County interconnect.  I assume that this must be posted on the bullet=
in board the same as any other CIAC.  Is this correct? =20

Also, the economics are based on NNG revenues covering both TW's and NNG's =
capital expenditure.  For recovery purposes wouldn't it be better for NNG t=
o reimburse TW 100% of its costs?  Other wise isn't there a miss-match in t=
hat the volumes will be reflected in NNG's rate design with 50% of the cost=
 of service residing on TW's books? =20

I had a meeting with Steve Harris this afternoon.  We would like to receive=
 reimbursement of half of the capital expenditures for the Gray County Inte=
rconnect in 2001.  This will be done as a CIAC.  Any tax gross up will wash=
 at an ETS level.  Please let me know when we can expect payment.


Thanks

Tracy
