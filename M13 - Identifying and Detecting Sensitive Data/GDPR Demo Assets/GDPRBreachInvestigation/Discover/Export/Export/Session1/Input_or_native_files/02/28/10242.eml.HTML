<br>Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palatka, Florida, June 2 (Bloomberg) -- Natural gas is
<br>burning again at Florida Power &amp; Light Co.'s Putnam power plant in
<br>Palatka.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last winter, Florida's largest utility reconfigured the plant
<br>to run on fuel oil instead of natural gas, a cleaner-burning fuel
<br>that for years had been comparatively cheap. Last month, as gas
<br>prices plunged to a 10-month low, the plant switched back to gas.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florida Power &amp; Light wasn't the only one. Many electric
<br>utilities in the U.S. are able to burn both fuels, and several are
<br>making the switch to gas, which is now cheaper than oil in some
<br>regions. Companies such as Detroit Edison Co. had been burning oil
<br>since the winter.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``It wasn't really until the early May timeframe, when gas
<br>and oil prices crossed paths and gas became cheaper,'' that the
<br>switch was made, said Gary Lapplander, the company's manager of
<br>fuel supply. Michigan's largest electric utility had been running
<br>its 780-megawatt Greenwood plant near Port Huron on oil since last
<br>December.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on the
<br>New York Mercantile Exchange to a record $10.10 per million
<br>British thermal units in late December, more than quadruple the
<br>year-earlier price. This year, prices have fallen below $4, partly
<br>because last year's rally caused so many generators and industrial
<br>customers to seek alternate fuels, such as oil.
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving Money
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel can account for more than 90 percent of a power plant's
<br>operating costs, according to some estimates.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mild weather across the U.S. this spring has reduced demand
<br>for gas to heat homes and power air conditioners, while record
<br>drilling in the past year has led to higher gas flows from U.S.
<br>wells. Since late March, utilities have been pumping gas into
<br>underground storage at almost three times last year's rate,
<br>according to American Gas Association figures.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fuel oil has a much different story. Prices for No. 6
<br>residual fuel oil -- the grade most commonly burned in power
<br>plants -- are linked to crude oil prices, which have climbed 4
<br>percent this year.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut
<br>crude oil production twice this year after raising it four times
<br>in 2000. And refiners have been sopping up supplies in recent
<br>months to make gasoline for the summer driving season.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natural gas prices at Chicago's distribution hub fell below
<br>fuel oil prices during the week ended May 18, the first time it
<br>was cheaper in almost seven months, according to Bloomberg
<br>figures. Fuel oil prices in Chicago are little changed this year.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``It's really a factor of economics,'' said Carol Clawson, a
<br>spokeswoman for Juno Beach, Florida-based FPL Group Inc., parent
<br>of Florida Power &amp; Light, which can switch about a quarter of its
<br>power plants between gas and oil on a few hours' notice. ``We are
<br>detecting gas prices coming down, and as that occurs, we are going
<br>back to gas.''
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear of a Rally
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, some power-plant operators may be wary of
<br>switching back to gas because of the chances for a rally this
<br>summer, said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus in
<br>New York. As hot weather arrives, homeowners and businesses will
<br>turn up their air conditioners, pushing electricity use higher and
<br>lifting gas demand. Natural gas futures last summer rose 29
<br>percent.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding to that demand, gas-fired power plants with about
<br>25,000 megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer,
<br>according to a U.S. Energy Department report published last month.
<br>Last year, about 22,000 megawatts of new gas plants started up,
<br>boosting total U.S. gas demand by 500 billion cubic feet, or 2.3
<br>percent. A megawatt is enough to light 1,000 homes.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other variables in the gas market include the extent of any
<br>heat waves this summer, and whether hurricanes will enter the Gulf
<br>of Mexico, disrupting operations at offshore rigs that account for
<br>a quarter of U.S. production.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``People don't fully trust gas,'' Evans said. ``They're
<br>wondering if it's going to remain the cheaper fuel, or if it's
<br>just going to turn around and do to them what it did last
<br>winter.''
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still Cheaper
<br>
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil is still cheaper than gas in some regions. In the New
<br>York City area, where utilities don't have to pay as much to get
<br>oil delivered from tanker terminals in New York harbor, heavy fuel
<br>oil costs $3.89 per million Btu, compared with $3.99 for natural
<br>gas, according to Bloomberg figures.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, the drop in gas prices has prompted Brooklyn, New
<br>York-based Keyspan Energy Corp. to increase gas's share of its
<br>total power generation to about 40 percent, said company spokesman
<br>David Manning. That's up from about 3.5 percent at one point last
<br>December.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, almost all of the company's plants would be burning
<br>gas at this time of year, Manning said. Keyspan produces power for
<br>about 1.1 million customers on Long Island.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``We're right on the cusp'' of gas prices falling low enough
<br>to switch the remainder of the company's generation away from oil,
<br>he said. ``We would anticipate we will be running on gas even more
<br>this summer, unless something dramatic happens with the weather.''
