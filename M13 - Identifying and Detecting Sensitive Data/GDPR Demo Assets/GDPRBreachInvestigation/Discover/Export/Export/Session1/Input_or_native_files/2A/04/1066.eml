Per our telephone conversations, property tax information for the budget pr=
ocess is only needed for the calendar years 2001 and 2002.

In order to complete the property tax portion of this process and provide t=
he cash flow analysis for Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pip=
eline Company, the Property Tax Department needs the following information =
for the calendar year 2001:

(1) Net Utility Operating Income (Net Income before Interest & Taxes)=20
(2) Capital Expenditures (Income Enhancement/Marketing Projects only): pref=
erably by state, if not; total by company

In order to provide the required information in a timely manner, please for=
ward the aforementioned information to my attention as soon as it becomes a=
vailable. If you have any other questions or comments, please advise.
