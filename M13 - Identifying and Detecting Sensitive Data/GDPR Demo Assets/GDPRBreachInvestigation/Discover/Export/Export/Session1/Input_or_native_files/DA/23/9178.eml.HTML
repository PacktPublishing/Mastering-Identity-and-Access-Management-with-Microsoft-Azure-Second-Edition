Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed
<br>to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron. &nbsp;The total 
<br>dollars
<br>required was approximately $4.25 million. &nbsp;An amount of $3.55 million needed 
<br>for 
<br>the Transco historical imbalance resolution. &nbsp;The remaining balance was needed
<br>for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention 
<br>last year.
<br>
<br>Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical 
<br>imbalance.
<br>The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional 
<br>funds
<br>for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under &quot;The Office of 
<br>the
<br>Chairman&quot;. &nbsp;Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money 
<br>to
<br>be reserved at the &quot;Chairman&quot; level since the additional funds were needed to 
<br>correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&amp;L. &nbsp;
<br>Also, the 
<br>arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement 
<br>payments
<br>were made by Enron.
<br>
<br>As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news. &nbsp;First, the 
<br>bad news.
<br>After a great deal of investigation, it appears that there currently is no 
<br>reserve at the
<br>&quot;Office of the Chairman&quot; &nbsp;for these additional funds. &nbsp;Now, the good news. &nbsp;
<br>Georgeanne 
<br>will take the necessary steps to make sure there is money available so that 
<br>we can
<br>quickly resolve these issues with Keyspan and Transco.
<br>
<br>If you have questions, please give me a call.
