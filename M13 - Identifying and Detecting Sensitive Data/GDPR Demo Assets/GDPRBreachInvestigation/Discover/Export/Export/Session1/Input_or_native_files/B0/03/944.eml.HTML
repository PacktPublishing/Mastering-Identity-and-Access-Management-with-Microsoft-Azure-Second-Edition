Hello Tracy,
<br>
<br>I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and
<br>Hoang this week related to the project.
<br>
<br>On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources. &nbsp;I know that you guys
<br>have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
<br>difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that
<br>are committed to the project. &nbsp;This is due to the fact that they currently
<br>have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
<br>project. &nbsp;It is having an impact on the timeline. &nbsp;The home office model
<br>could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
<br>delivered as requested. &nbsp;Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
<br>lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application. &nbsp;It is important
<br>that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will
<br>become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.
<br>
<br>We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
<br>production. &nbsp;This individual should be identified and running the
<br>administration duties as soon as possible. &nbsp;My fear is that without proper
<br>ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the
<br>short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.
<br>
<br>We've had some technical issues with the production and development
<br>environment. &nbsp;Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact
<br>on the timeline.
<br>
<br>There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated
<br>and it has resulted in the redesign of the model. &nbsp;Much time has been spent
<br>on gathering business process information from various people which has
<br>caused a delay in the model development.
<br>
<br>I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
<br>produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and
<br>result in a successful implementation.
<br>
<br>
<br>Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if
<br>you would like to discuss this.
