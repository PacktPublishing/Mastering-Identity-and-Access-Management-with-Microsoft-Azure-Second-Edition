<br>Tracy:
<br>
<br>Sorry to bother you with this one again -
<br>
<br>in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost. &nbsp;In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&amp;S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!
