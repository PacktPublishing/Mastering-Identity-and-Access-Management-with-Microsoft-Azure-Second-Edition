Tracy,  We will be increasing NNG Operations Capital Current Estimate by $4=
.0MM with the forecast coming up to cover the additional Cooper Pre-Buy Sta=
ndby.  Morris indicated that there was a pot of Capital dollars somewhere i=
n ETS that can be reduced so that we don't increase the total ETS Capital B=
udget.  Can you confirm this?

Thanks,  Elaine

I spoke with Morris, and we will increase NNG Operations for the $4.0MM and=
 request that it be offset elsewhere within ETS.  I believe that Rod may ha=
ve a pot at the ETS level.  We will need to work with Tracy on this.

If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know.=20

Thanks,  Elaine

We're talking about $4.0m for 2001. Should I go ahead & increase our Curr E=
st to be sent out this week?  Diane

As far as I know, we are to adjust our C/E up for the amount of the pre-by =
bookings.

$1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory=
.  According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year.  How are=
 these dollars to be funded?  I am assuming that we will be adjusting our C=
E for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you =
would like for us to handle.

If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.

Thanks!
