Hello everyone!
<br>Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already 
<br>that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will 
<br>no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams. &nbsp;I am moving 
<br>over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams. &nbsp;
<br>Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement. &nbsp;She can be reached at X3-3131 
<br>and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs 
<br>immediately.
<br>I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her 
<br>with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while. &nbsp;Please forward 
<br>this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.
<br>
<br>It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Edie
<br>
