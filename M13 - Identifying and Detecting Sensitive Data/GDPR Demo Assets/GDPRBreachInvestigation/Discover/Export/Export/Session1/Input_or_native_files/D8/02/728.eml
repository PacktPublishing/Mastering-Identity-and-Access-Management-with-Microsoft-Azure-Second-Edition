	Becky,

	This will confirm our conversation.  You will make the redrafting changes =
necessary on the petition and attachments to file in Harris County court, a=
nd have everything ready for us to file on Monday. Once service is ready, w=
e will then serve the Secretary of State  of Texas (I may go ahead and have=
 a process server do that for us, to prevent any questions about proper ser=
vice later on).  Keep your fingers crossed and let's hope that Sherwood Pur=
nell doesn't try to dodge the Secretary of State.

	Many thanks.

	Britt

	P.S.--Lee, we already have the check cut to pay for filing, etc., but get =
with Becky today and take a look, just to make sure it appears to be in the=
 proper amount.  If it is not, let's order a check in the right amount toda=
y.  Thanks.
