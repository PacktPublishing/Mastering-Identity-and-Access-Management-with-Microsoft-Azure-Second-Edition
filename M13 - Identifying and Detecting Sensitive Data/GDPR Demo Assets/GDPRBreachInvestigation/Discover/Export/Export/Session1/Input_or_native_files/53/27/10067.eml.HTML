Tracy,
<br> 
<br>Only the Ad Val and Tax Compliance groups intend to charge clean fuels. &nbsp;If Methanol is the only thing left and it is Corporate, then the charges would stay on the Corp. tax cost centers instead of being charged to ETS. &nbsp;Thanks for your information. &nbsp;This will not change your 2002 allocations since I had not included the Clean Fuels charges.
<br> 
<br>Dawn

<br>Clean Fuels was comprised of three companies. &nbsp;The MTBE plant and the Mt Belvieu storage and grid were sold to EOTT this year. &nbsp;Enron kept the Methanol and has shut it down. &nbsp;I guess I need to understand exactly what they are doing for which company. &nbsp;The Methanol plant actually rolls up to Corp and other, so allocating costs to them will be a hit to Corp.

<br> 
<br>Any decision on the question of billing Clean Fuels?

<br>Tracy,
<br> 
<br>We have several cost centers in Tax that wish to allocate to Clean Fuels. &nbsp;How do you want us to handle these assuming that they should not go to EOTT?

<br>Dawn: &nbsp;Only assets were sold to EOTT. &nbsp;The legal entities still remain with Enron. &nbsp;The $30,000 cost represents clean fuel companies and Methnol.

<br>Greek, 
<br>
<br>Our understanding is that Clean Fuels has been sold to EOTT and so I included the Clean Fuels allocation in with EOTT's number.

<br>
<br>Dawn: &nbsp;Laura Mattox of EOTT called inquiring about her tax charge(CC14502) of $79,000 which is 3 times more than last year. &nbsp;My records show a charge of $49,000 to EOTT. &nbsp;Can you help me explain the $30,000 difference?
<br>
<br>Thanks, 
<br>Greek
