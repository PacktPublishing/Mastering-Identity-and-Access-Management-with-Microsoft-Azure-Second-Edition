<br>Tanya,
<br>
<br>This is a follow-up to my two calls this morning. &nbsp;I have talked to Pat Ebert at Ashland. &nbsp;I asked her why they refuse to pay their October 2001 invoices. &nbsp;She said that her management wants to speak to someone in upper management at Enron. &nbsp;I asked to speak to her manager and was told that she was in a meeting. &nbsp;I asked her to get her out of the meeting. &nbsp;She did not comply. &nbsp;Her managers name is Sherry Tackett. &nbsp;Her phone number is 614-790-6941. &nbsp;I left her a messsage. &nbsp;I told her that I expect payment for the ENA upstream, for 559,000+, and for ENA for 374,000+. &nbsp;I also told her she received to commodity so the payment is due. &nbsp;I told her &nbsp;expect it today. &nbsp;I left my phone number and told her to call me as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Tom McFatridge
