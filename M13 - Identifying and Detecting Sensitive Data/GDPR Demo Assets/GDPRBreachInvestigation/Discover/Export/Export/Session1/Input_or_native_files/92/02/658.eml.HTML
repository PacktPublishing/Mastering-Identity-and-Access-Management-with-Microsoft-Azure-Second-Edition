Hello, following up our PGE Budget presentation I am forwarding you the
<br>following information.
<br>
<br>Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with
<br>the NNG disclosure schedule. &nbsp;The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6
<br>MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should
<br>not be an issue.
<br>
<br>Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the
<br>budget presentation? &nbsp;I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me
<br>posted as to what the plan is.
<br>
<br>Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures. &nbsp;The
<br>file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail. &nbsp;Note that in our UE-115
<br>ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the &nbsp;2000-2002
<br>budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend
<br>the money we have to refund it to customers. &nbsp;As an fyi - I've pasted in
<br>below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.
<br>
<br>
<br>Q. &nbsp;What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS /
<br>IT Disallowance?
<br>
<br>A. &nbsp;After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital
<br>costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be
<br>prudent. &nbsp;As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT
<br>investments, subject to a Staff audit. &nbsp;PGE will place into base rates
<br>100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002
<br>capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below. &nbsp;The 2002
<br>revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the
<br>actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs. &nbsp;OPUC Staff
<br>will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital
<br>items listed below.
<br>
<br>1. Customer information system.
<br>2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.
<br>3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the
<br>meters).
<br>4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.
<br>
<br>Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until
<br>2003. &nbsp;Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff
<br>audit procedures and standards. &nbsp;Only those costs that are reasonable
<br>and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the &quot;actual&quot; revenue
<br>requirement calculation. &nbsp;Accordingly, customers will receive a refund
<br>for any costs PGE does not expend or costs the OPUC finds imprudent.
<br>
<br>Let me know if you have any questions.
