NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.

We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fu=
el based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.
This out of balance collection goes to trackers.  We could lower the amount=
s over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this co=
ntract goes short.  (stop charging out-of-balance retention has other probl=
ems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001.  This=
 is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part.  That is, we ne=
ed to make these two contracts long to the system each month.  Or, put an O=
BA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems a=
ssocated with it).

Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see =
if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and =
Tracy Geaccone to discuss.=20

The non-controllable factors are NNG's Field fuel rate keeps increasing mak=
ing it consistently over the 4.5%, and lower gas prices increase the exposu=
re to EPPI.

I still need to understand why we are at the 4.45% and what we can do in th=
e future if anything to control it.   Can someone help me with this?

Thanks

I have attached a summary and schedules which indicate the following.

EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69
Oneok owes NNG	$  92,774.99
Net amount due is	$246,383.70  Per Dan Fancler

Oneok invoices total $301,383.96.  Oneok has not recognized that some month=
s they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.
 << File: GPM 101021  101073 Recalculation.xls >> Oneok is pushing hard for=
 the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG m=
arketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Je=
nnifer Lev.
