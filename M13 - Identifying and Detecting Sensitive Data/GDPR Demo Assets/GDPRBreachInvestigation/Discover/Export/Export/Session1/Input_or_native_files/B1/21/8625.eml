I would like to have a meeting on October 31st (maybe later if that date wo=
n't work), either in the AM or the PM, but probably about 3 hours or so.   =
 I would like to discuss organizations and how we are going to provide the =
support the EGS organization requires both at Stan's level and at each leve=
l in the organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns=
 you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there a=
re people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions o=
f Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in th=
is process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above. =
   Please let Kathy know who they are.    I would like to know if you are a=
vailable or have a preference for morning or afternoon.

Thanks.     =20
