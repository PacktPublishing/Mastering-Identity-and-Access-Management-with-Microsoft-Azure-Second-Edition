As stated on the revised 2002 Plan Key Dates calendar, Friday, September 7 was the day preliminary allocations were due to any business unit which will be recieving allocations from your business unit. &nbsp;If you have not yet communicated the amounts with the BUs who will be a receiver of costs from your BU, this is a freindly suggestion that you may want to at least touch base with the receiver BUs. &nbsp;Since targets are to scheduled to be communicated this week and some groups have already begun to build their Plan, it is important that some additional unexpected allocated costs aren't a surprise at the last minute. &nbsp;Some business units may interpret not hearing anything from another business unit as no allocations are forthcoming. &nbsp;This week is important to the overall planning process, since questions and clarifications regarding allocations should be taking place this in order to facilitate the allocations being finalized by the 14th (the end of this week). 
<br>Thanks,
<br>Steve
<br>
<br>
<br>PS - If you have already sent your allocations out, please disregard.
