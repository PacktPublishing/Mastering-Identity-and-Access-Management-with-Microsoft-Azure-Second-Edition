No problem, we will have them to you by 2pm. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I am still working on 
<br>getting this info to you in a more systematic manner but our IT people 
<br>are currently swamped.

<br>Subject: Important bidweek information
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Scott,
<br> &nbsp;Please let your gas traders know that Inside FERC will not accept bidweek
<br>prices via fax any later than 2 p.m. Eastern time. It takes a great deal of 
<br>time
<br>to input each deal by hand and then re-check the data for accuracy -- and 
<br>that's
<br>before we even begin to analyze each pricing point to determine the indexes.
<br> &nbsp;If anyone has any questions, they can contact me at the number below.
<br>Regards,
<br>Liane Kucher, Associate Editor
<br>Inside FERC's Gas Market Report
