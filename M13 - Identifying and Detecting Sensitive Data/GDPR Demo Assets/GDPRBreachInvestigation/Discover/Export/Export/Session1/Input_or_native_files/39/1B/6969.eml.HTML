So far we have a pretty good turn out for the camp out. &nbsp;The rest of you
<br>that have not rsvp'd can still let me know by first thing tomorrow. &nbsp;I know
<br>you're waiting for those baseball tournament schedules to decide. &nbsp;The only
<br>thing I need to know is if you will be there for dinner, otherwise come and
<br>go as you wish.
<br>
<br>If you decide to join us later and we are not at the house, we are at the
<br>beach or at the water slide down the street. &nbsp;Any questions call our cell
<br>phones. &nbsp;Rod at 713-249-9300 and me at 281-389-9366.
<br>
<br>Ya Ta Hey,
