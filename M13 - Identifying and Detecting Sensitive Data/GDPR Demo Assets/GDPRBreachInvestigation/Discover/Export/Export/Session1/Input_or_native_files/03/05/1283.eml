This is Saunders entire world plus Borcyk's world for tax.   Accounting and=
 Reporting are consolidated, not worth splitting and the cost estimate shou=
ld be a net Enron estimate.

Call Kirk Stevens for the Portland info and Tod (unless you know who else) =
for the EREC world.   What about Wessex?=20

Lets discuss this before I start pulling data.  I want to make sure I pull =
in the right groups.  I have a call into Corp to try to figure out what the=
y are getting at here.

Hi everyone.  I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Caus=
ey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most =
current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s=
). =20

What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimatel=
y reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Acco=
unting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support depa=
rtments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for exam=
ple, Sally Beck's world).  I say "department" because I don't want just acc=
ountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If y=
ou have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and =
we'll discuss.

The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as o=
f July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At=
 a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, report=
ing, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible,=
 i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a chal=
lenge given the timing of the request. =20

Additionally, if you can provide me with a "current estimate" for the group=
s you report, that would be ideal.  I know that the official CE doesn't go =
to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that project=
s your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.

The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is sec=
ondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.  If yo=
u can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me s=
o we can discuss.

Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.  Th=
is will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to con=
solidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,=20
Steve
