When was it recovered?  As cash?
Is there not a period of time this can be "disputed"?  (I thought there was=
 a six month period under Order 581)
Given the significant UAF on TW, why is this gain deemed real, while the ot=
hers have not?

The UAF is at a gain so it has already been recovered.  TW was reserving ag=
ainst the possibility of an undefined future measurement adjustment from a =
shipper which would lower the previously recovered UAF gain.

We do not want to reserve for this.  Please let it flow through income.

Thanks

Tracy

In July 2001 TW had a UAF gain of 93,400 dt valued at $258,718.00 which wil=
l be recorded in August business.

As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receip=
t value at the Williams interconnect.  In my opinion a reserve of the $258,=
718 July gain is not necessary since we currently have $4.3 million already=
 set up and the lack of recourse available to Williams.  Please indicate ma=
nagements wishes.

Debbie and I have just returned from the NNG/TW UAF meeting.  On TW, a leak=
ey receipt value was repaired on July 10, 2001 at an interconnect with Will=
iams Field Services.  This caused unmetered gas receipts to flow into TW an=
d there does not appear to be any way to estimated Williams losses.  Starti=
ng in August we expect the UAF gains to disappear from TW.  If so, we recom=
mend reversal of the UAF reserves at a time management feels appropriate.  =

Until then, TW has another $1 million of UAF gains which we wish to reserve=

The UAF for 0601 has been reconiled and the accounting gain is 316,474 pric=
ed at $3.20.  The impact of the gain is $1,012,717.  This amount should be =

Let me know if you have questions.
