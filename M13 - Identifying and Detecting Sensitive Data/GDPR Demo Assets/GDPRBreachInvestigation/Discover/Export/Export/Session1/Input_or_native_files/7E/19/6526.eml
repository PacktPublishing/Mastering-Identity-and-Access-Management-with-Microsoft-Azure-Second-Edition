I won't guarantee I can make it, but I will try.     Here are some thoughts=
, as we move forward with this deal:

Levelized rates - will require separate rate base, not rolled in, since the=
 base system is not levelized and separate tariff schedules like a FTS-2
	Also we need to see what the GAAP income statments will look like and what=
 the return on equity will really look like if we do this.    It may surpri=
se some of the 	people.    I also think we need to make sure Stan is OK wit=
h the potential result if we are going to offer it.=20
