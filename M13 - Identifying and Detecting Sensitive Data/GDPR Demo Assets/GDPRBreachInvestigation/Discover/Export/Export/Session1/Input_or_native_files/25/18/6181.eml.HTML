When was it recovered? &nbsp;As cash?
<br>Is there not a period of time this can be &quot;disputed&quot;? &nbsp;(I thought there was a six month period under Order 581)
<br>Given the significant UAF on TW, why is this gain deemed real, while the others have not?

<br>The UAF is at a gain so it has already been recovered. &nbsp;TW was reserving against the possibility of an undefined future measurement adjustment from a shipper which would lower the previously recovered UAF gain.

<br>We do not want to reserve for this. &nbsp;Please let it flow through income.
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>
<br>In July 2001 TW had a UAF gain of 93,400 dt valued at $258,718.00 which will be recorded in August business.
<br>
<br>As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receipt value at the Williams interconnect. &nbsp;In my opinion a reserve of the $258,718 July gain is not necessary since we currently have $4.3 million already set up and the lack of recourse available to Williams. &nbsp;Please indicate managements wishes.

<br>
<br>Debbie and I have just returned from the NNG/TW UAF meeting. &nbsp;On TW, a leakey receipt value was repaired on July 10, 2001 at an interconnect with Williams Field Services. &nbsp;This caused unmetered gas receipts to flow into TW and there does not appear to be any way to estimated Williams losses. &nbsp;Starting in August we expect the UAF gains to disappear from TW. &nbsp;If so, we recommend reversal of the UAF reserves at a time management feels appropriate. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Until then, TW has another $1 million of UAF gains which we wish to reserve.'

<br>The UAF for 0601 has been reconiled and the accounting gain is 316,474 priced at $3.20. &nbsp;The impact of the gain is $1,012,717. &nbsp;This amount should be reserved. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Let me know if you have questions.
