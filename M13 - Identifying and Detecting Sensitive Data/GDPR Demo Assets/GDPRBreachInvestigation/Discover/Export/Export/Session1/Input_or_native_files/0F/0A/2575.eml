 Sorry we could not meet.  The problem seems to be Mary lists the total in =
R 112386 as $114,109.41 while in SAP the total is $64,720.92.  Please see a=
ttached.  I don't see how Mary's report could possibly tie to SAP.  Please =
provide me an SAP report that details $114,109.41 in R112386 because the on=
e I run keeps coming up with $64,720.92.=20
