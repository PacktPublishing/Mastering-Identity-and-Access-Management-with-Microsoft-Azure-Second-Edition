<br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project
<br>
<br>
<br>The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio. &nbsp;While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event. &nbsp;The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees. &nbsp;However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past. &nbsp;Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves. &nbsp;The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.
<br>
<br>We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous &quot;Home Video&quot; to be presented at the Management Conference. &nbsp;The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses. &nbsp;However, there are a few rules to follow.
<br>1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
<br>2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000. &nbsp;Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video. &nbsp;Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
<br>3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging. &nbsp;They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
<br>4.) &nbsp;By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video. &nbsp;To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
<br>5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
<br>6.) &nbsp;Awards will be given for creativity and humor. &nbsp;The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, &quot;Enny&quot; will also be awarded for &quot;Best Overall Video.&quot;
<br>
<br>If you have any questions about the &quot;Home Video&quot; project, please contact myself or Mary Clark. &nbsp;
