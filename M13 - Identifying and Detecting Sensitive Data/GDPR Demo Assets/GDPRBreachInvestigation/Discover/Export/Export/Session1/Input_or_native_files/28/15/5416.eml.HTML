After the capital charge was recorded in CS in March, an error was found in the calculation. &nbsp;For most business units, this results in only a small adjustment. &nbsp;We plan to make the necessary correction and send the revised file to everyone. &nbsp;After it has been reviewed, we will book the capital charge for Jan - April in FI in May business. &nbsp;We will then book May's capital charge in FI in June. &nbsp;We have not yet resolved the timing on booking June. &nbsp;Since the balance sheet and cash flow continue to change after the income statement is closed, &nbsp;it is difficult to record an accurate capital charge for the current month. &nbsp;Suggestions are welcome.
