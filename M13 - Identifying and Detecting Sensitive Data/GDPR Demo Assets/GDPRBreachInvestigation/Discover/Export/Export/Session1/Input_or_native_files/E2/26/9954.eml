Tracy, our current forecast includes a gross bonus accrual of $13m for the
full year (Note that a portion of this amount is capitalize through our lab=
or
loading process - about 33%).  This is significantly below our target level
for the year ($16.5m) and last year's actual payout of $16.7m.  We reduced
these amounts based on our lower that expected performance in Q3 that we've
been discussing.  Early this year we we're accruing at a maximum amount of
$17.6 since our forecasts looked better at the time.
Here' s the layout of how this falls by quarter in the forecast:
Q1 - $4.4
Q2 - $4.4
Q3 - $1.0 (forecast)
Q4 - $3.2 (forecast)
       $13.0

Based on how Q4 results look, we will reassess our accrual levels at that
time.   Let me know if you have any questions.=20
