Tracy,
I'm totally confused as to who we're supposed to send numbers to.  I know y=

 I can make Mei-Ling happy?  Kenny is out of the office today.

Thanks,
Paula

Paula,

I did not send you this before because I was told that Azurix will not be p=
art of EGAS.  I was just told that we need to get Sept flash and 3CE of Azu=
rix from you.  Please input Azurix Sept preliminary flash numbers directly =
in 3CE file ASAP and let me know when done.  Please call with any question.

named "EGAS Format" was created within "3rd CE" folder for you to save "EGA=
S Format income statement".
   3.   Indirect Cash Flow
   4.   Variance Explanation for both 3CE vs Plan and 3CE vs 2CE( We only n=
eed the explanation of IBIT variance for 3CE vs 2CE)

planation" column (set up to the right of the monthly income statement) for=
