Tracy

Per our conversation earlier this week, EOTT's projection for 2002 Net Inco=
me is $26.9 million.  My understanding is that this is all that will be req=
uired from us in connection with the 2002 Plan process at Enron.  Please ad=
vise if this is not correct..  I'll be out of the office next week.  If any=
thing further is required, during that time, please contact John as soon as=
 possible.

Given the internet problems we've had lately, please acknowledge receipt of=
 this email by sending me a reply.  Thanks
Karl
