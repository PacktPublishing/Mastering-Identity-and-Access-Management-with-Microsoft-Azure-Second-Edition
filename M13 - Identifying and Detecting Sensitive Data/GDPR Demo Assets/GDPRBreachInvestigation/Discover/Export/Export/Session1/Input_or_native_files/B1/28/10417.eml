Tracy-

I will see if we have any updates, although I doubt we would change the num=
ber from last we met.  I believe the presentation of the numbers has caused=
 some confusion.  We are forecasting a (5.2) recurring loss, plus a (13.8) =
loss on Marlin, totaling (19.0) loss.  I think you added the 19 and the 5.2=
 to get to the 24.2 you have listed below.  The correct total is (19.0). =20

Rod and I are meeting with Stan Monday afternoon, October 22, to talk about=
 the 4th Quarter.  I have listed below the latest IBIT impact to Enron for =
the 4th Quarter that I have.  Please let me know if there are any changes a=

PGG  $28.0
EREC $53.2
Azurix  ($24.2) including Marlin
Clean fuels ($21.1)
