We will defer to Rates & Certificates on this one.    We need to be thinkin=
g about what each entity is getting for it's investment in the project.=20

And there should be no tax grossup since the taxable entity will not be pay=
ing tax on the transaction.     And I think the tariff reads that it can on=
ly be charged if in fact it will be paid.

Steve Harris has asked for a CIAC for 50% of TW's construction costs on the=
 Gray County interconnect.  I assume that this must be posted on the bullet=
in board the same as any other CIAC.  Is this correct? =20

Also, the economics are based on NNG revenues covering both TW's and NNG's =
capital expenditure.  For recovery purposes wouldn't it be better for NNG t=
o reimburse TW 100% of its costs?  Other wise isn't there a miss-match in t=
hat the volumes will be reflected in NNG's rate design with 50% of the cost=
 of service residing on TW's books? =20

I had a meeting with Steve Harris this afternoon.  We would like to receive=
 reimbursement of half of the capital expenditures for the Gray County Inte=
rconnect in 2001.  This will be done as a CIAC.  Any tax gross up will wash=
 at an ETS level.  Please let me know when we can expect payment.


Thanks

Tracy
