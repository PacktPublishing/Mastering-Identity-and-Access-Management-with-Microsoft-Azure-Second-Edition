Do you want us to include the peanuts and workable lavatory?

Kidding aside.
The trip normally takes 3.7hrs round trip depending on winds/weather etc. 3=
.7*$4,800=3D$17,760.
Of course a corporate aircraft can never be compared to commercial travel o=
n cost alone. There is no comparison. It is all in the safety, confidential=
ity, time effectiveness, customer contact and support, flexibility of routi=
ng and scheduling, being free from distractions and interruptions, less str=
ess on executives and retention of key employees. Depending on who is on bo=
ard, when you weigh the cost of unproductive time using the airlines vs. co=
nducting business with your whole group during a trip you will see the cost=
 expenditure, when you need it,  is invaluable.

Caroline,  What I been told is the following:

	$3,775/hr  fixed costs plus variable costs associated with specific trips =
i.e. fuel, landing fees, catering etc.

Typically I think an average per hour cost of $4,500 is used.

Gary,  Does this sound reasonable for budgeting purposes?

For the 2002 Plan NNG will budget aviation by function i.e commercial, oper=
ations etc.  Therefore each functional area needs to assess their company p=
lane usage and budget accordingly for 2002.

Gary,  Once we have rolled each functional area up to the NNG legal entity =
level we will be able to provide you with the total NNG aviation budget for=
 2002.=20
