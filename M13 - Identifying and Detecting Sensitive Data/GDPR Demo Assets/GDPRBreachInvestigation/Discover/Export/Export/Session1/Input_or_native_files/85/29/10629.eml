Thanks, Tracy. The reclass turned out to be 43.3 mill, which is what I adju=
sted 3rd ce for. Is this the only adjustment you want us to make? We have a=
 couple of other large items (goodwill, FAS 133), maybe at this point we sh=
ould just include them in the current cash flow forecast. Let me know, than=
ks.

It is actually $45 million.  I would need I revised 3rd CE and also reflect=
 the change in the cash flow forecast.  I am sorry I did not get back to yo=
u sooner on this.

Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we =
update it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 =
mill revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the Oct=
ober monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.=20
