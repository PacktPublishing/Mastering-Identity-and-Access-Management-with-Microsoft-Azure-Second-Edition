Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations=
 to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure,=
 Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are pro=
viding a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than=
 that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make in=
formed choices regarding the services that they receive. =20

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review=
 in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some =
of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and O=
ctober 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to=
 finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions=
 to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT=
 Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have be=
en included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget =
as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included i=
n individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versu=
s 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational chang=
es to be relevant. =20

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital d=
ollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (prod=
ucts or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granul=
ar level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.=
 =20

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates=
 licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detai=
l on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, =
line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capit=
al spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to fin=
alize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business unit=
s on which projects to undertake in 2002.  =20

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to f=
inalize them,  please call one of us. =20
