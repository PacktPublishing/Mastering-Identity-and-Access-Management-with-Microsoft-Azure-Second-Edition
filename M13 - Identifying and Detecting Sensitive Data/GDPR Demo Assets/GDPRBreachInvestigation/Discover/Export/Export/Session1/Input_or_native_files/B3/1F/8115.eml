Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) =
to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the Sa=
n Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representati=
ve could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as D=
ecember is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facili=
ties to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig run=
s completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these tim=
es:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving t=
he dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.
