<br>
<br>
<br>Parents - Are you up for a makeup game this Friday, Oct 19, at 6:30?
<br>This game is optional. &nbsp;Otherwise, we don't have a regularly scheduled
<br>game this weekend. &nbsp;This is a fine oppty to enjoy more exciting Charger
<br>soccer!

<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; I am coach of the WUSC Leopards; we were scheduled to play your
<br>&gt; Chargers
<br>&gt; but it was rained out.
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Would you be interested in having a make up game? &nbsp;I have reserved a
<br>&gt; time slot at 630 pm on Friday 10/19. &nbsp;Are you and your players able to
<br>&gt; make it?
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Please get back to me as soon as you can. &nbsp;We've had two rainouts, and
<br>&gt; I'll get with the other team if you can't make it.
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Thanks,
<br>&gt; 
<br>&gt; Mike
