	As you may be aware, I am conducting an in-house seminar on compliance wit=
h labor and employment laws and the practice of good employee relations.  T=
his 4 hour, interactive program is tailored to Enron's culture and ETS-spec=
ific issues.  Stan Horton and the ETS Division Heads have mandated attendan=
ce for all Managers and above, and for those persons who have supervisory r=
esponsibility.

	The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-rel=
ated litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee p=
roductivity.  In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to under=
stand the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal=
 requirements.

	Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassmen=
t free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance mana=
gement; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to e=
ffectively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.

	There are three sessions open in October -- the 3rd, 17th, and 31st.  They=
 run from 8:00 to Noon.  Please=20
contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in one of these=
 sessions.  She will then provide you the exact location and other particul=
ars.

	Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Brian
