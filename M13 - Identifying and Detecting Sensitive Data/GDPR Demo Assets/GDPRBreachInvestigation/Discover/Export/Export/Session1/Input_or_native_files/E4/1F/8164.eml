We can probably do this.  However, if Steve Harris has not approved by then=

  This next one will be October month forecast.  The YTD will be September =

 finalized.  When we are at the end of a QTR (like now) and forecasting the=
 first month of the next QTR I will add a section for the next QTR (in this=
 case 4th QTR).

he ETS Website.  Also, keep submitting and inputing into the Website the mo=

Also, when filling in your variances, watch for rounding issues where it mi=
ght show up as zeroes but the totals would foot differently when adding the=
