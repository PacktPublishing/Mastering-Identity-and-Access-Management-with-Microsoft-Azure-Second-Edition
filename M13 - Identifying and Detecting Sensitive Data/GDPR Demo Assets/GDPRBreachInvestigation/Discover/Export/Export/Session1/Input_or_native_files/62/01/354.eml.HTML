Tracy, &nbsp;To confirm our conversation last night, we'll get you a SWAG by the end of the day on Monday (prorated based on Aug 2001 YTD Actuals). &nbsp;We will finalize the detail to match what is in our Plan by cost element by next Friday, the 12th, end of day. &nbsp;Please let me know if this as a problem. &nbsp;Otherwise, I'll assume this is acceptable.
<br>
<br>Thanks, &nbsp;Elaine
