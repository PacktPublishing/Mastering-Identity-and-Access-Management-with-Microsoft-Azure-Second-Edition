Our budget for SAP was $700,000 for 2001.  Has it really gone up that much =
($6,000,000 divided by four is $1,500,000)?

The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken =
that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 millio=
n will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  Mary will change all but=
 NBP.  Cheryl please make change for NBP.  This is per Rod's instructions. =
 When we get the user list we will revise.


Thanks

Tracy
