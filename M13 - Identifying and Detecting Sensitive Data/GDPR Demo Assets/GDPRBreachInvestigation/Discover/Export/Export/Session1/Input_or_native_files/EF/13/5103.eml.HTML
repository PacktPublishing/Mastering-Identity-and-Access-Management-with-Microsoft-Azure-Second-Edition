I thought they only supported the six Houston people.
<br>
<br>I know for a fact, that the California is self contained. &nbsp;I believe that Europe is the same way.

<br>Does networks really support all of these people? &nbsp;If assets are sold, I assume support would go away?
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>Tracy,
<br>
<br>The file we received from Corporate listed an estimated 461 domestic employees and 526 international (987 total) for the 2002 plan. &nbsp;This information came from the Corporate headcount request to the BU's that was due on 6/22. &nbsp;Currently there's a group of 937 (451 domestic, 486 international) that is being supported. &nbsp;I'll call you tomorrow to see why there's such a large discrepancy between this headcount and the 6 you're projecting.
<br>
<br>Listed below are services the Infrastructure group provides to EREC:
<br>
<br>IT Security, Policy, Monitoring, and Investigation
<br>Software License Management
<br>Terminal Server Operations
<br>DMZ Security
<br>24x7 Support
<br>
<br>passthrough services:
<br>Calling Card
<br>Video Conferencing
<br>Remote Access

<br>But there are services performed beyond houston. &nbsp;I do not have to allocation with me, so I can't itemize the detail. &nbsp;Allison or LaMetrice, will you pls reply wih some of the other services?

<br>This is going to happen. &nbsp;Besides, there are only 6 people in HOuston, we can't be talking alot of dollars here.

<br>Mike, is this a FOR SURE thing? &nbsp;What about timing? &nbsp;Of the announcement as well as closing? &nbsp;If we build our allocations on things that may happen, we will be changing it daily. &nbsp;I think we must assume status quo until it's final.

<br>Allison,
<br>Just spoke with Tracy. &nbsp;The plan for EREC is to sell approx 85% of the equity to a 3rd party in 2001. &nbsp;Once sale is complete, the EREC Houston personnel will not be relying on Infrastructure services. &nbsp;Please communicate this to the appropriate Infrastructure assessment groups. &nbsp;I'd like to have ready before the final BU assessments go out this week. &nbsp;
<br>Thanks,
<br>Mike
