I'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barne=
y presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts=
 allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a ph=
one mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caro=
line Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges fo=
r 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you sh=
ed some light on the Accounting charge?

Thanks
Karl
