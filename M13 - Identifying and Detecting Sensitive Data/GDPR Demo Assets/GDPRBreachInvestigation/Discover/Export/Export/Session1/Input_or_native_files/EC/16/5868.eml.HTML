&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the files you have sent for the 2002 Corp. Costs you have a column for ETS HQ. &nbsp;It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that one column. &nbsp;We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other companies. &nbsp;For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 1195, these need to be separated out in detail. &nbsp;Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 have employees. &nbsp;Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet. &nbsp;Thank you for your assistance. &nbsp;Should you have any questions please call.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary
<br>
