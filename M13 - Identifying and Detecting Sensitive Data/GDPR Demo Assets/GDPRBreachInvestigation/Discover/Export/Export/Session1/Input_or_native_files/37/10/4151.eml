Latest Findings from Meridien:

1. Get Smart: Intelligent Order Routing and the Institutional Investor
(Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D734
(Wholesale eFinancial Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D735

Institutional investors, like their individual counterparts, want to get th=
e best possible execution of their order. While some institutional investor=
s have been improving their order management strategies and technology thro=
ughout the 1990s, the buy side as a whole is only now realizing that it nee=
ds to pay closer attention to how orders are treated to determine the true =
operating costs of a mutual or pension fund. New technologies are emerging =
that are helping them educate themselves and trade smarter. One such techno=
logy, intelligent order routing, is a direct response to the emergence of m=
ore-and more fragmented-marketplaces. Initially embraced by day traders tra=
ding via direct access brokers, this technology is now making its way up th=
e food chain. This report looks at various definitions of intelligence in o=
rder routing, focusing in particular on institutional investors. At the end=
 of the day, it is not so much about establishing a standard definition of =
best execution as it is about making sure that the investing firm (or indiv=
idual) feels that it has sufficient control of the order.


2. Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Dealers in the USA
(Customer Interaction Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D736
Many financial institutions are devoting considerable attention to figure o=
ut how to serve the wealth management needs of individuals. We have noted a=
 growing, almost feverish pitch among a rapidly expanding number of applica=
tion and platform vendors that claim wealth management and/or investment ma=
nagement as a solution focus. This brief examines the state of the retail i=
nvestor marketplace in the United States, which represents the most logical=
 view of the investment management opportunity. We conclude with our perspe=
ctive of life cycle opportunities and technology solution capabilities that=
 financial institutions should consider to remain effective competitors. A =
related Customer Knowledge research brief, "Analytical CRM: Understanding C=
ustomer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business Models" (Vol. 4, Brie=
f 7, June 7, 2001), examines relevant analytical challenges and opportuniti=
es.


3. Analytical CRM: Customer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business M=
odels
(Customer Knowledge Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D737

Retail broker/dealers in the United States face a dilemma: as they strive t=
o excel in the delivery of topnotch investment services, they must find eno=
ugh retail investors of the right types. Our companion Customer Interaction=
 research brief "Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Deale=
rs in the USA" (Vol. 4, Brief 8, June 7, 2001) defines the retail investor =
marketplace and the role of customer interaction technology solutions. In t=
his brief, we examine business models and relevant analytical challenges an=
d opportunities.


4. Wireless Payments at the Point of Sales: Expanding POSsibilities
(e-Payments Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=3D738
Financial institutions face a choice: they can participate in developing ne=
w wireless payment technologies, or they can sit on the sidelines as others=
 take the lead. If they don't get involved, they risk disintermediation by =
entities like telcos that are not hesitating to jump into the driver's seat=
 with wireless. This report examines the present state of wireless technolo=
gy and the competing standards that are available today. It also looks at m=
obile telecommunications firms and their motivations to promote wireless pa=
yments. The report contains three case studies of wireless payments program=
s: one a joint bank/telco initiative, one a bank initiative, and one a comp=
any initiative.
