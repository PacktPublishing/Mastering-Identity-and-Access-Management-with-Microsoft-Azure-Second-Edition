The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston =
time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom. =20

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will=
 be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employee=
s will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do =
not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on =
the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your bad=
ge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and w=
e request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup =
at the entrance to the ballroom.
