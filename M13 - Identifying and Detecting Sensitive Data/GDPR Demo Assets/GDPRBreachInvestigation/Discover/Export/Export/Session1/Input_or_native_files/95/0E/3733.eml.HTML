Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.
<br> 
<br>I'm not real certain of the project organization, but I'll give it a try:
<br> 
<br>The Adaytum implementation is a corporate project managed under the Project Sunrise umbrella. &nbsp;Joe Darensburg is the lead reporting to Jan Johnson. &nbsp;Both of these people are originally from corp accounting. &nbsp;I believe Jan has moved back into the corp accounting group and the overall project is now reporting to Susan Bellinghausen from the ISC.
<br> 
<br>ETS has it's own project which is being led by Tracy Geaccone (ETS Consolidations, which reports to Rod Hayslett). &nbsp;I believe this was originally set up to address ETS' specific planning/forecasting needs and to dovetail into the corp level implementation. &nbsp;Hoang Vo is an Adaytum consultant working for Tracy.
<br> 
<br>Lee Baker manages planning and forecasting for the Operations Services Group, which reports to Elaine Concklin and is part of Morris Brassfield's organization. &nbsp;I believe Elaine has a dotted line to Rod as well. &nbsp;Lee's team uses Hoang quite a bit as well.
<br> 
<br>I'll call you in a few minutes and we can discuss further.
<br>

<br>
<br>Cheryl Perchal is going to coordinate a phone conference with you, Teri Galissini and Hoang Vo sometime this week.
<br>We have many questions, not just how actuals could feed into Adaytum for current estimate.
<br> 
<br>You can maybe help me understand how project management is organized for ETS's Adaytum project(s).
<br>1. I understand Teri G is project lead. &nbsp;Does she report to Rod Hayslett? &nbsp;Is anyone from Steve Hotte's area involved?
<br>2. Is the project being capitalized or 100% expensed? &nbsp;No one here has anything like SOW, project authorization, capital project coding for timesheets, status reporting, etc.
<br> 
<br>Thanks, Fred

<br>Fred,
<br> 
<br>I'm out of the office today but took a few minutes to check in and keep the mountain of email from piling too high. &nbsp;With regard to the actuals item mentioned below, this came to light when my team was doing research on developing cost center reporting out of the finacial data warehouse. &nbsp;Next Wednesday we have a detailed planning meeting on requirements after which we will be asking the ISC (supports sap, adaytum, data warehouse, etc.) &nbsp;for an estimate and schedule. &nbsp;Basically what we are shooting for is plan in the data warehouse to support cost center/variance reporting and actuals in Adaytum to support analysis and development of current estimates and forecasts. &nbsp;
<br> 
<br>I call you Monday and we can discuss further. &nbsp;Have a good Thanksgiving.
<br>Greg &nbsp;

<br>Rita's consultant rate is $150. &nbsp;Hoang's rate is either $150 or $215. &nbsp;I don't like paying for redesign on a product that should handle large cubes. &nbsp;I plan to talk with Greg Lewis about this issue.

<br>
<br>I am out of the office tomorrow and wanted to get some communication out on the Adaytum O&amp;M project. 
<br>I haven't had a chance to talk to Phil on this so this is only my opinion on the project so far. &nbsp;This will just be a brief rundown. I can expand upon any of the items at your request.
<br>
<br>Planned this week: 
<br>Call Hoang Vo on a couple issues. &nbsp;(See accomplished below) 
<br>Decipher what Rita accomplished in the model and what still needs to be completed. 
<br>Understand the model. 
<br>
<br>Accomplished this week: 
<br>Called Hoang Vo on 11-19. &nbsp;Issues: 
<br>1. Can't open large cubes. &nbsp;Hoang knows this is a problem. &nbsp;There is a similar issue with a Houston application which they need to redesign. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>2. &nbsp;Importing to contributor after allocations ran. Hoang is working on a script. &nbsp;He will send to us once he has it finished. &nbsp;Until then we could do it manually but Hoang would have to step us though this process taking away from his time writing the script. Side note: if we can't get the allocations back to contributor, then the users (me right now) can't do much testing besides inputting.
<br>
<br>Documentation. &nbsp;Phil and I have been going through d-lists and d-cubes trying to determine the purpose of each. &nbsp;Discovered some d-lists and d-cubes that we may not need and documented questions on others. &nbsp;This written documentation should assist new users of our application.
<br>
<br>Cube Renaming - We have renamed the Merit SBP Model to just Merit Model. &nbsp;This is the only bright spot in the week as renaming cubes seems to be a simple process with the name change occurring in all the appropriate places for links and macros to still work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br>Outstanding Issues: 
<br>Phil and I have come to the conclusion that we need further assistance from Hoang or another consultant familiar with this application. &nbsp;We are in need of a summary, manager build, and some sort of documented process on how to run this application. &nbsp;I am not at all comfortable with the application in its present state but feel we can make some progress if we had a complete roadmap of the application and someone to ask questions of.
<br>
<br>In a phone conference this afternoon, we were told that getting actuals into the Adaytum O&amp;M application would not be ready for January 2002 close. &nbsp;ETS thought that the whole actuals process was being addressed under the Project Sunrise umbrella which is not the case. &nbsp;Now ETS must champion this effort. It is being headed up by Greg Lewis but there is not an estimated completion date.
