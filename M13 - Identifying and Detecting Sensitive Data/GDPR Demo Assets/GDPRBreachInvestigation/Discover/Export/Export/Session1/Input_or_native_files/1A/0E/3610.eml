Scott,

Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under Davi=
d Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not =
to mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the in=
terviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been pu=
shed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and=
 is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you n=
eed me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would=
 be happy to help.

Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not wa=
nt to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another th=
ought is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option,=
 it may be tough to get him back.

Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back=
 from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

Kim

John/Kim/David

Just called - can come in on Weds 23rd ( reason why he can't come in earlie=
r - vacation from 16th to 19th ) . Still interested in talking - simply a s=
cheduling issue - don't seem to be any barriers to moving forward.

They have just moved office - hence new number (7139890962)

Does the 23rd work ?

I didn't mention the Scott Neal call.

Neil
