Adam / Stan,

I had a follow-up meeting with Gary Fitch regarding Enron Wind's aviation. =
 Gray indicated the following:

*	Aviation budget number look comparable to operator standards (approx. $1,=
900 / hour, 600 hour estimate)
*	The plane has a market value of $1.8 - $2.0 million and a book value of $=
2.2 million
*	Turbo prop charters for trips to Tehachapi would run in excess of $1,100 =
/ hour and may be limited as there are only two qualified operators
*	The Cessna is the only jet suitable for use to Tehachapi based on runway =
length and altitude
*	Gary will make a site visit before the end of the year

Assuming that of the budgeted 600 hours of operation, only 400 hours would =
require charter, the cost of charter would approach $0.5 million of the tot=
al budget of $1.2 million.  This plus the flexibility of using the plan on =
longer hauls (e.g., to Houston) make it economically justified.

My recommendation is that based on the current situation, we retain the air=
craft.

Tod
