I received these comments this afternoon from JPMorgan.     I need to have =
some help putting together a story to counteract the basics of this story f=
rom CERA.

Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our=
 consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/=
2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional=
 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more effic=
ient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired gene=
ration, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW o=
f electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power an=
d subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of t=
ransmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line an=
d power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximatel=
y 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Ju=
an gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put deco=
ntracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, a=
nd especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the "wild card" in their view is unforeseen California power deman=
d growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues=
.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we ca=
n set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks
