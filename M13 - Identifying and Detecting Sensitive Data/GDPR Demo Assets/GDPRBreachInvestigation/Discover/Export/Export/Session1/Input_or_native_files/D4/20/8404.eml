Again, I do apologize for all of the revisions.  The only change in this re=
vision is the deletion of line 20, "Taxes Other Than Income", in the 3rd sh=
eet, "O&M by Department".  It was included erroneously.  Thanks to Mei-Ling=
 Kaster for discovering this.  TOTI has a section of its own beginning on l=
ine 49.  Please use this template to submit your Plans.
Thanks,
Steve
