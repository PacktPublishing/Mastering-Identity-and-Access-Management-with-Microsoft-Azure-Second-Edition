We can probably do this. &nbsp;However, if Steve Harris has not approved by then, I will not be able to send. &nbsp;Why so early? &nbsp;Why not first thing Friday?

<br>Henry Baker will email you no later than &nbsp;each Thursday morning with the last &quot;Summary&quot; with the YTD and QTR info section titles adjusted accordingly. &nbsp;This next one will be October month forecast. &nbsp;The YTD will be September YTD with the Actual line reading Actual/Forecast since September is not yet finalized. &nbsp;When we are at the end of a QTR (like now) and forecasting the first month of the next QTR I will add a section for the next QTR (in this case 4th QTR).
<br>
<br>This week's template follows:
<br> &lt;&lt; File: WeeklyWeb100501.XLS &gt;&gt; 
<br>Please fill in your company's data on the template and return by email to Henry Baker no later than 3:00 pm on each Thursday.
<br>
<br>The report will be titled &quot;Weekly Commercial Net Contribution Summary&quot; and will ultimately reside in the ETS Updates, Financial Forecasts section of the ETS Website. &nbsp;Also, keep submitting and inputing into the Website the more detailed weekly reports as you have been. &nbsp;We will not be publishing the Summary by email but watch for it on the Website. &nbsp;The way the Website works, it might not show up until Friday morning. &nbsp;If you need an advance copy, let Henry know and he can email it to you.
<br>
<br>Also, when filling in your variances, watch for rounding issues where it might show up as zeroes but the totals would foot differently when adding the visual amounts.
