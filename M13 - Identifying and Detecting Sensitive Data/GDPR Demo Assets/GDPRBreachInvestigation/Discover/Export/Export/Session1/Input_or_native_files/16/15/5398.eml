	I submitted the Parking Provision outline to Bay Gas last week after our m=
eeting.
=09
	I need to circle back to determine where we are relative to getting pricin=
g pulled together
	for the gas portion.  I've been in need to put a hard offer in front of th=
is customer for several
	weeks now.  They are in the process of making a critical decision & I woul=
d like to have
	something in hand that values the Parking optionality. =20

	Thanks
	mk

	Team,
	I'm not sure what the latest discussions you've had since our last meeting=
, but I need to get this=20
	concept outlined and in the hands of my customer.  They are making their d=
ecision any day now=20
	and I believe this structure will add to the value of our Compression Serv=
ice and reduce our=20
	dependence on the minimum load factor. =20

	I've attached a basic outline as I see it.  Please review or we will discu=
ss at our 3:00 meeting today.
	I would like to define or understand our (Enron's) wish list as well as a =
relative value at a minimum. =20
	I need to get the specifics to my customer tomorrow since it's not going t=
o happen today. =20

	I ultimately need to have a price for the gas that ECS would be receiving =
ASAP. =20

	Thanks,
	mk
