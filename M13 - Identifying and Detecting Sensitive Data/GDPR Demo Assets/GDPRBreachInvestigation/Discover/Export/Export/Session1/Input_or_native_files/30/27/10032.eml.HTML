I definately support &nbsp;a promotion. &nbsp;I have not given up on the contract, 
<br>although I have not figured out how to make it more palatable for her while 
<br>ensuring 
<br>she is committed to Enron. &nbsp;

<br>Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment 
<br>Contract. &nbsp;I understand her issues. &nbsp;Even before she informed me of her 
<br>decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to 
<br>Director. &nbsp;I would like to get your thoughts on this.
<br>
