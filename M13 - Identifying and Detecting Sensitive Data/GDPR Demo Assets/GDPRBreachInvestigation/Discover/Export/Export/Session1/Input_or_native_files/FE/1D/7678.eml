Rod,

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to yo=
u?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier t=
o send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM fo=
r 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $4=
7 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 proj=
ections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s n=
ot millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operati=
ons CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

Thanks
Sarah
