Jerry, I received a copy of an email you addressed to Bill Brown regarding =
a conversation you had with Karen Choyce about who is responsible for Uncla=
imed Property Reporting to the States.  The Corporate Secretary Division ce=
ntralized this function a few years ago and I am the person responsible for=
 making sure that Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries stay in compliance.

I think Karen meant that it is the responsibility of each business unit to =
identify the unclaimed checks, move the funds to the Escheat Liability Acco=
unt, communicate this information to the Corporate Secretary's Division, an=
d reconcile the general ledger as it pertains to their business unit.

It is my responsibility to prepare the reports and remit the funds to the a=
pplicable state before the deadline.  Please forward any correspondence you=
 receive from the States regarding this matter (including notices and forms=
) to my attention for further handling.  Thank you for your cooperation.
