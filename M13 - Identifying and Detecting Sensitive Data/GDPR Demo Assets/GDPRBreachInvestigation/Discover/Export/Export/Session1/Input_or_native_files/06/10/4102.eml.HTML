Attached is the revised calendar for the completion of the 2002 Plan. &nbsp;As you will note, the dates have been moved up approximately 2 weeks in most cases. &nbsp;This is a result of the recent management changes and executive availability.
<br>
<br>A couple of notes on the dates:
<br>
<br>-Please note that dates for assessments apply to ALL BUSINESS UNITS who will be senders of costs.
<br>-The October 18th due date for the Presentation Pages: I will provide more information at a later date on this.
<br>-The dates highlighted in yellow are not 2002 Plan related, but merely a reminder of other significant items that will be occurring in this time frame.
<br>
<br>Also included in the file FYI is the PROPOSED schedule for the Plan/Executive Business Reviews with the Office of the Chairman. &nbsp;These are still subject to change. &nbsp;Rick Causey's office (Sharron Westbrook) is coordinating the schedules of the applicable attendees. &nbsp;I will let you know when these are final.
<br>
<br>Additionally, the Plan will be submitted to Corporate in the traditional format, Excel files. &nbsp;We will be sending the templates out on (or by) September 20, as reflected in the revised calendar. &nbsp;However, our strategy is still to enter 2002 with the full plan ( I/S, B/S, Cash Flow) loaded into Adaytum and to utilize Adaytum going forward from that point. &nbsp;Therefore, we will be enhancing the Excel files to include the level of detail that will be loaded into Adaytum, so there will be additional lines and/or supplemental schedules added to the files.
<br>
<br>One more thing - please communicate all of this information to the appropriate individuals in your business unit/group.
<br>
<br>If you have any questions, please give me a call.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Steve
