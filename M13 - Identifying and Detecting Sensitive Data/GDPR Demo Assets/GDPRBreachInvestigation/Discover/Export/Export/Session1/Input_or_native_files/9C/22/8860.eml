Scott, I would like to sue Kim in an expanded role within the group. She wi=
ll=20
still be responsible for all of her current activities but will also work=20
with the group on Pipeline postings and expansions, RFP and information=20
responses, Development of Presentations, etc.  I think that in the long run=
=20
she can develop and be moved into other positions.  Especially after she=20
earns her degree.  I have spoken with HR.  We will monitor to assure that s=
he=20
does not let any of her curent responsibilities slide.  Let me know if you=
=20
have and concerns.


Also, I have completed the Performance plan for John Hodge ( Required due t=
o=20
his ranking in 2000).  I will leave a copy on your desk for review and=20
execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.
