Caroline,  What I been told is the following:

	$3,775/hr  fixed costs plus variable costs associated with specific trips =
i.e. fuel, landing fees, catering etc.

Typically I think an average per hour cost of $4,500 is used.

Gary,  Does this sound reasonable for budgeting purposes?

For the 2002 Plan NNG will budget aviation by function i.e commercial, oper=
ations etc.  Therefore each functional area needs to assess their company p=
lane usage and budget accordingly for 2002.

Gary,  Once we have rolled each functional area up to the NNG legal entity =
level we will be able to provide you with the total NNG aviation budget for=
 2002.=20
