<br>Sorry - this email got lost.

<br>Please coordinate through Colin or Keith. &nbsp;Your best bet is Lisa Hobbs, Colin's most excellent assistant.

<br>Good morning, Tracy! &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Stan wants us to look at the week of May 6, 2002, to travel to Europe and meet with Colin's team(s) and Adam's team(s). &nbsp;&nbsp;See if we can hit all the necessary sites within that one week time span.
<br>
<br>I'll await to hear back from you. 
<br>
<br>Thanks!
