Tracy, FYI, I already provided a list of Q4 challenges/hurdles to Rod a couple
<br>of days ago. &nbsp;Let me know if you need a copy.
<br>

<br>I only need bonus data. Don't worry about 4Q data today. Please send directly
<br>to me. 
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>
<br>Hello everyone. Management has begun to look toward the 4th quarter and is
<br>requesting certain information from each business unit. 
<br>
<br>I need to know, by 10:30am Wednesday: 
<br>
<br>a. Total bonus accrual for 2001 
<br>b. Amount of bonus accrual that is (or will be) accrued YTD through September
<br>2001 
<br>c. Amount remaining to be accrued in 4th Qtr 2001 
<br>
<br>Additionally, each CAO* has been asked to compile a list of potential
<br>hurdles/challenges/clean-up items for the 4th Qtr. that will be discussed at
<br>an offsite this week. You may want to touch base with them and make sure they
<br>are aware of this and come prepared. I have sent a reminder message to them
<br>today also. 
<br>
<br>Thanks, 
<br>Steve 
<br>
<br>
<br>*with the exception of EGEP (Jim call me if you want to discuss) 
<br>
<br>
<br>PS - Faith and Tracy - I'm assuming you guys will coordinate for wholesale and
<br>stan's world respectively. If you'd like me to contact any group directly, let
<br>me know.
