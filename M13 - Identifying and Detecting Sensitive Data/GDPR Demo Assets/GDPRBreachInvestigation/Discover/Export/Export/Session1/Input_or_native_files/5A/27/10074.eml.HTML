&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may be aware, I am conducting an in-house seminar on compliance with labor and employment laws and the practice of good employee relations. &nbsp;This 4 hour, interactive program is tailored to Enron's culture and ETS-specific issues. &nbsp;Stan Horton and the ETS Division Heads have mandated attendance for all Managers and above, and for those persons who have supervisory responsibility.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-related litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee productivity. &nbsp;In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to understand the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal requirements.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassment free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance management; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to effectively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three sessions open in October -- the 3rd, 17th, and 31st. &nbsp;They run from 8:00 to Noon. &nbsp;Please 
<br>contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in one of these sessions. &nbsp;She will then provide you the exact location and other particulars.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
<br>
<br>Brian
