The project can not be justified, if you have the capital cost of the piggi=
ng facilities.  On a stand alone basis without the pigging facilities we ca=
n justify the project.

Have you had a chance to run this?  If not, when do you think you will?

Thanks

Tracy,

Have you made any progress on the economic analysis?

Thanks,


John

Tracy,

10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.

This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the =
+/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I sugg=
est it be used for this initial analysis.

Thanks,


John

How much additional capacity/volumes will I get?

Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPl=
ata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloom=
field and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning =
& application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with meth=
anol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application tim=
e period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-ap=
ply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,


John
