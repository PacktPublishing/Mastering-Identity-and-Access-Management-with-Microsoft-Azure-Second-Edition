Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the bus=
iness.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and wi=
ll let you know. =20

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my gro=
up's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI,=
 I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's gr=
oup and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS bud=
get.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Ple=
ase let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John
