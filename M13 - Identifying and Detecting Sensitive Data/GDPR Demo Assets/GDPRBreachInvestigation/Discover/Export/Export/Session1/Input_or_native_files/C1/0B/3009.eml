	After the budget session, I thought I needed to make sure one more process=
 is started and in order.     Insurance costs have risen and there may be a=
 disconnect between expectations and actual results.    I would like to thi=
nk that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Op=
erating Companies in a short time.   =20

	I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles=
 are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the reque=
st for quotes.   	This is so that everyone is dealing with the same informa=
tion.     I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the mar=
ket and then give the group program 	a right to match the deal.    I think =
the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles=
 are needed  and then follow that up with the information 	to go out in the=
 RFP.

	However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules.     In the e=
vent the Operating Company (OC) wishes  to secure a "market price" for thei=
r insurance:
	1.	The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing.  The Broker is subject =
to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services) =
	approval.  Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.   An appeal of=
 an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.
	2.	CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM,  the nec=
essary underwriting information.
	3.	The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages,  limits, and =
deductibles they require for their business.
	4.	CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to t=
he competing brokers.
	5.	The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the =
bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.
	6.	CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report th=
e results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropria=
te senior 	manager within Enron.
	7.	OC will elect the program and price they  prefer and CRM will have the =
right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the plac=
ement of a 	separate program.
	8.	For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated=
 broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker=
 becomes 	a "correspondent" within the established Enron Broker Network.  T=
his will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.

	I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory concl=
usion in the process.     Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed =
program, 	because obviously we need to get started ASAP.
