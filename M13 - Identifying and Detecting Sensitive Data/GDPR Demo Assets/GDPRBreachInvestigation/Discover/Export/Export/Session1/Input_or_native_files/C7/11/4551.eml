I don't know if we have the Trailblazer info in house.  Mike McGowan in Oma=
ha would be the only one who might know.  If he does not have it, we wii ha=
ve to call Trailblazer directly.  I don't know how to get in touch with Mik=
e outside of the office.  Can you wait until MOnday?  If not, I can try inf=
ormation in Omaha.
