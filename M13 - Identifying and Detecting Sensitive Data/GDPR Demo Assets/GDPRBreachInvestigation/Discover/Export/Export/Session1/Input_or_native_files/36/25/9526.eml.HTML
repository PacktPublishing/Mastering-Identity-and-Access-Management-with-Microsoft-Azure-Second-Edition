The O &amp; M/G &amp; A graph needs to be done in two graphs. &nbsp;One for direct costs and one for Corporate costs. &nbsp;This way you can better see the increase in the Corp costs. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br> 
<br>Company name should be replaced by your business unit name.
<br>EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc. &nbsp;This works &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area.
<br>The O&amp;M/G&amp;A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that have increased significantly.
<br>Please use the Arial font.
<br>It may work better if you insert your slides into this template.
<br>
<br>We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan. &nbsp;If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.
<br>
<br>I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan. &nbsp;However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at
<br>9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible. &nbsp;I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.
<br>
<br>On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.
<br>
<br>If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-853-7372.
