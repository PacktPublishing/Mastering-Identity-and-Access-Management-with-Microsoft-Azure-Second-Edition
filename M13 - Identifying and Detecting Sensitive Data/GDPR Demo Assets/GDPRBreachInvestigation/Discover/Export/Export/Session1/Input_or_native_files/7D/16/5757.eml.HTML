NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.
<br>
<br>We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fuel based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.
<br>This out of balance collection goes to trackers. &nbsp;We could lower the amounts over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this contract goes short. &nbsp;(stop charging out-of-balance retention has other problems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001. &nbsp;This is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part. &nbsp;That is, we need to make these two contracts long to the system each month. &nbsp;Or, put an OBA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems assocated with it).
<br>
<br>Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone to discuss. 
<br>
<br>The non-controllable factors are NNG's Field fuel rate keeps increasing making it consistently over the 4.5%, and lower gas prices increase the exposure to EPPI.

<br>
<br>I still need to understand why we are at the 4.45% and what we can do in the future if anything to control it. &nbsp;&nbsp;Can someone help me with this?
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>
<br>I have attached a summary and schedules which indicate the following.
<br>
<br>EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69
<br>Oneok owes NNG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ &nbsp;92,774.99
<br>Net amount due is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$246,383.70 &nbsp;Per Dan Fancler
<br>
<br>Oneok invoices total $301,383.96. &nbsp;Oneok has not recognized that some months they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.
<br> &lt;&lt; File: GPM 101021 &nbsp;101073 Recalculation.xls &gt;&gt; Oneok is pushing hard for the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG marketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Jennifer Lev.
