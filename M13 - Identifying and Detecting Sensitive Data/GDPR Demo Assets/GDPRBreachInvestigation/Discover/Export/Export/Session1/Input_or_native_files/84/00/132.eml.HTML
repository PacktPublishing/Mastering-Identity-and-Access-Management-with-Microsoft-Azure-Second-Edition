Tracy, our current forecast includes a gross bonus accrual of $13m for the
<br>full year (Note that a portion of this amount is capitalize through our labor
<br>loading process - about 33%). &nbsp;This is significantly below our target level
<br>for the year ($16.5m) and last year's actual payout of $16.7m. &nbsp;We reduced
<br>these amounts based on our lower that expected performance in Q3 that we've
<br>been discussing. &nbsp;Early this year we we're accruing at a maximum amount of
<br>$17.6 since our forecasts looked better at the time.
<br>Here' s the layout of how this falls by quarter in the forecast:
<br>Q1 - $4.4
<br>Q2 - $4.4
<br>Q3 - $1.0 (forecast)
<br>Q4 - $3.2 (forecast)
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$13.0
<br>
<br>Based on how Q4 results look, we will reassess our accrual levels at that
<br>time. &nbsp;&nbsp;Let me know if you have any questions. 
<br>

<br>I only need bonus data. Don't worry about 4Q data today. Please send directly
<br>to me. 
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>Hello everyone. Management has begun to look toward the 4th quarter and is
<br>requesting certain information from each business unit. 
<br>
<br>I need to know, by 10:30am Wednesday: 
<br>
<br>a. Total bonus accrual for 2001 
<br>b. Amount of bonus accrual that is (or will be) accrued YTD through September
<br>2001 
<br>c. Amount remaining to be accrued in 4th Qtr 2001 
<br>
<br>Additionally, each CAO* has been asked to compile a list of potential
<br>hurdles/challenges/clean-up items for the 4th Qtr. that will be discussed at
<br>an offsite this week. You may want to touch base with them and make sure they
<br>are aware of this and come prepared. I have sent a reminder message to them
<br>today also. 
<br>
<br>Thanks, 
<br>Steve 
<br>
<br>
<br>*with the exception of EGEP (Jim call me if you want to discuss) 
<br>
<br>
<br>PS - Faith and Tracy - I'm assuming you guys will coordinate for wholesale and
<br>stan's world respectively. If you'd like me to contact any group directly, let
<br>me know.
