<br>FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
<br>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
<br>Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
<br>Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 &lt;http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html&gt;). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
<br>Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
<br>ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.
