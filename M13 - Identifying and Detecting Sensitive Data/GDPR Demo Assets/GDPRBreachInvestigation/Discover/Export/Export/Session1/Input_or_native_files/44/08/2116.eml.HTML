<br>Subject: SoCalGas Complaint (Message from Greg Porter)

<br>
<br>MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER
<br>
<br>________________________________________________
<br>As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 28, 2001. &nbsp;The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement. &nbsp;SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001. &nbsp;In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:
<br>
<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.
<br>
<br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.
<br>
<br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.
<br>
<br>In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR. &nbsp;Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.
<br>
<br>We will advise as new developments warrant. &nbsp;In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.
