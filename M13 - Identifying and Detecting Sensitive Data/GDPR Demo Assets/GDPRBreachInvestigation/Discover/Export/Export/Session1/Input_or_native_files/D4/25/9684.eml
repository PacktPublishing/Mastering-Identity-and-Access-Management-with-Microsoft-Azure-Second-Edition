Hi All--

Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Lin=
e / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding.

Transco is saying they won't implement "prior to April 1" but haven't decid=
ed on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not=
 specify a date by which Transco had to implement.  Transco will have to ma=
ke another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little wh=
ile before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to t=
he cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dol=
lars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's=
 RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that=
 we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the nec=
essary Unify changes.

On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas =
Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt =
a more "Transco-like" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue pe=
nalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round betwe=
en the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.=
  Will keep you posted.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Suzanne

TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES

Capping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas=
 Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval fro=
m FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's=
 ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply w=
ith orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco an=
d other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practice=
s and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 58=
7.

According to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing co=
mputer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied wi=
th Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Lin=
e complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line =
plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP0=
1-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco'=
s proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, t=
o incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule=
, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in =
a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.

The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which al=
lows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the ear=
liest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort l=
evel about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to per=
mit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacit=
y release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's=
 ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also gener=
ally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and ho=
ld harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the c=
ommission told the company to remove language that would force customers to=
 indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

On order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on=
 issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenu=
e sharing.
FERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction bet=
ween the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the cla=
im that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Tra=
nsco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can =
rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as T=
ransco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly si=
tuated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must a=
dd a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to =
be processed within two hours.

FERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tie=
red cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthoriz=
ed overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified "why such =
substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days," said the
commission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imba=
lance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it assert=
s are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that "Transco has f=
ailed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily result=
s in a loss of transportation revenue." But the commission went on to say t=
hat it "may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that ship=
pers are abusing imbalance trading" to avoid certain charges.

Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from=
 trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imba=
lances. FERC said that "it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA =
imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the=
 two cannot be traded."

FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by =
revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/lo=
w daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed d=
uring and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission=
 Co. to "remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system," =
FERC said.

To stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01=
-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subje=
ct to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of c=
ustomer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor =
replacing
plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the app=
licable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commissi=
on noted that Texas Gas "has demonstrated with its data a close correlation=
 between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for y=
ears and has not subsided."

However, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price in=
dex at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest dail=
y price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language=
, the order explained that daily high/low index prices "may unduly increase=
 penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637."

The order went on to say that "a less draconian measure" may be appropriate=
. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism "that would inject an e=
lement of uncertainty regarding the eventual price" if it wanted to provide=
 "an incentive for shippers to remain in balance," FERC said.
