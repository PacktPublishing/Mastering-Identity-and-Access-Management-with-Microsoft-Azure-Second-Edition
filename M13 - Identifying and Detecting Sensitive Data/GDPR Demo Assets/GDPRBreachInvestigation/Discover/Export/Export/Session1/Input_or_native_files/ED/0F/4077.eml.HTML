Fair Value is applied to plant and is being amortized over a useful life. 
<br>TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess over book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the time of the &nbsp;acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an applied to plant. Goodwill is meant to be a &quot;leftover&quot; after all costs have been allocated.

<br>Banks want to exclude goodwill. How would you explain the difference between the two?
