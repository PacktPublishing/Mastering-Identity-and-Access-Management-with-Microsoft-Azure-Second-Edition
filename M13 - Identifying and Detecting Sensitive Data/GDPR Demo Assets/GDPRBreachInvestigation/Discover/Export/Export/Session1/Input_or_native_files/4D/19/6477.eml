Kam, last year when this deal was set up, I set up deal tickets extending=20
into the future for 5 years (I would have extended it all the way to 2010 b=
ut=20
the Risk people back then asked me not to).  I have a new ticket for each=20
season since the volumes at each primary point and fuel change over the yea=
rs=20
and by season.  Extending Sitara 217969 through is going to be doubling=20
volumes for one and secondly, it won't reflect the correct primary points f=
or=20
each season.  I would really like to be consulted about these kind of chang=
es=20
before they are made and maybe we and Scott Neal could sit down and figure=
=20
out a better way to keep up with the value.  I'll run some facilitation=20
reports and see if this has caused us any trouble that we may need to fix.

Thanks, Sabra

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal=20
(2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and=20
locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you=
=20
have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge=
=20
deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future. =20
Sorry for the trouble.
