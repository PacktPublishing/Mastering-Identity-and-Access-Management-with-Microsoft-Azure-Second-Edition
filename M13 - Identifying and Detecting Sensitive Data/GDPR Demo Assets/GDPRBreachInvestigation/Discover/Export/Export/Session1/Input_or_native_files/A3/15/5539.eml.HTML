<br>
<br>eSource is based on your current year usage as a percentage of total current year usage. &nbsp;The amount is simply a guideline and charges will only be incurred if you use eSource in 2002.
<br>
<br>The additional amount for IT Infrastructure relates to a passthrough to Other Business Units of Infrastructure charges allocated to ENA from ENW. &nbsp;The basis for this is a calculation of FTE's based on 2002 Planned allocations from ENA support departments to your business unit. &nbsp;You are then charged a % of that support department's Infrastructure charges applicable to the FTE's.
<br>
<br>Please let me know if you have any further questions.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Edie

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edie,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you give us more information on these additional costs. &nbsp;What is the &quot;esource&quot; and why the additional expense for the IT Infrastructure? &nbsp;Thank you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary

<br>
<br>Attached, please find an updated allocations schedule which now reflects in a separate line the planned IT Infrastructure Allocation related to each support department that will be passed on to each Business Unit from ENA for 2002.
