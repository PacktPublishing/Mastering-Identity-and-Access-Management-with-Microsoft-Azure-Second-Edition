Per your request we have checked the MMF calculation data for NNG/TW/FGT/Tr=
ailblazer to Hyperion and/or SAP as appropriate.  Data checks out.
However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation.  =
It appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were include=
d in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year.  A ballpark es=
timate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG/TW fair valu=
e companies were excluded as they were last year.   That would mean a facto=
r of 19.0% rather than 19.1%.


Please call me when you want to discuss IMP.  I'm not sure exactly what you=
're looking for so trying to answer by e-mail probably wouldn't be very pro=
ductive.
