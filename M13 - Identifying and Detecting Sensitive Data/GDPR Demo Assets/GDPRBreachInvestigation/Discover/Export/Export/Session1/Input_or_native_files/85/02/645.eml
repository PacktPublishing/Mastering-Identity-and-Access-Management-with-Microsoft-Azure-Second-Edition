Sale of Enron's EDI IP to ECOutlook
Last week Enron sold to ECOutlook it's intellectual property related to it'=
s current EDI Hub for $3,000,000 and a 5 year warrant to purchase 500,000 s=
hares of ECOutlook stock at $2.25 per share.  Enron through a separate inve=
stment in ECOutlook in 2000 currently owns 6% of the company.  Once Enron e=
xecutes the warrant we would own a total of 7% of the company.  ECOutlook's=
 current customer list includes Bausch & Lomb, Bristol-Meyers, Ciba-Vision,=
 BASF, Dupont, Equistar/Lyondell, Perseco(McDonalds), Sun Microsystems, SYS=
CO, Pentacon and others. =20

The existing IP related to these types of transactions is now owned by ECPo=

Enron has also entered into a five-year O&M agreement and will transition t=
he operations of it's EDI Hub from ECPower to ECOutlook over the next six-m=
onths.  The O&M rates are flat to our deal with ECPower. =20

Enron also paid $100,000 to purchase a license to ECOutlook's B2B connectiv=
ity software called SDI Server.  We are looking at ways to use this softwar=
e to assist data transformation efforts between EIM, EGM and their trading =
partners.=20

Attached are the Asset Purchase, EDI O&M and EDI License Agreements for you=
r review.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  -  Tommy
