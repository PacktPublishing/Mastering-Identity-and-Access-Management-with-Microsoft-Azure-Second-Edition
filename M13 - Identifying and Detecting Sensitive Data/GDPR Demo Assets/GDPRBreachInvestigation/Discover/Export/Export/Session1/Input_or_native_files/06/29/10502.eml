I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully=
 able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin t=
o add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quit=
e possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as po=
ssible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do t=
his again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it =
does need to get complete this year.
