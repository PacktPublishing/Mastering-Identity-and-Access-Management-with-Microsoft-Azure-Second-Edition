Pat,

I mentioned to Jan that I would provide ETS (and other BUs) with specific A=
daytum project expense coding which has been used for previous training cla=
sses. She said it didn't matter to her if the business units coded their ad=
ditional training classes to its own expense account, without charging the =
costs directly to the expense work order which Project Sunrise set up. Ther=
efore, you do not need to transfer the costs which you have already coded t=
o expense on ETS' books.

Thanks !

Joe

Tracy,
Joe Darensbourg called me today asking about some invoices he received from=
 Adaytum for Contributor Administrator and Advanced Analyst training that I=
 am scheduled to take.  I told him that I had already expensed and sent a c=
heck to Adaytum for these two classes.
He, Joe, called me later to ask if I had coded this training to one of the =
Adaytum projects, namely an O&M project.  I told him I did not.  He said he=
 would send me an email with the project(s) number(s).  I haven't received =
it as yet.
Lee wants to be sure that you are aware of this since we don't have any way=
 of monitoring what is coming from Adaytum direct to Enron.
Thanks,
Pat

Pat,

Thanks for letting me know about the Adaytum invoice issue that Joe Darensb=
ourg contacted you about.  I have not been involved in any of the invoicing=
 with Adaytum, Tracy Geaccone is handling that for ETS.=20

Would you please e-mail Tracy and let her know the particulars of this issu=
e.   I assume Joe has taken care of it, but I would like to keep her in the=
 loop on any cost or invoice issues.

Thanks.
