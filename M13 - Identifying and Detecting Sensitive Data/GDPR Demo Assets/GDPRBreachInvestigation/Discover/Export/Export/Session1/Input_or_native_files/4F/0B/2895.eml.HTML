<br>Adam / Stan,
<br>
<br>I had a follow-up meeting with Gary Fitch regarding Enron Wind's aviation. &nbsp;Gray indicated the following:
<br>
<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aviation budget number look comparable to operator standards (approx. $1,900 / hour, 600 hour estimate)
<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane has a market value of $1.8 - $2.0 million and a book value of $2.2 million
<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turbo prop charters for trips to Tehachapi would run in excess of $1,100 / hour and may be limited as there are only two qualified operators
<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cessna is the only jet suitable for use to Tehachapi based on runway length and altitude
<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gary will make a site visit before the end of the year
<br>
<br>Assuming that of the budgeted 600 hours of operation, only 400 hours would require charter, the cost of charter would approach $0.5 million of the total budget of $1.2 million. &nbsp;This plus the flexibility of using the plan on longer hauls (e.g., to Houston) make it economically justified.
<br>
<br>My recommendation is that based on the current situation, we retain the aircraft.
<br>
<br>Tod
