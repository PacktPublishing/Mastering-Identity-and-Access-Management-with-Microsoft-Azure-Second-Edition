You might want to send these to Kim=20

Some brief comments:

1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period o=
f at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiratio=
n date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before th=
e expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as t=
his is optionality without any cost to them.=20
2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to estab=
lish an "Initial Recourse Rate" prior to the open season in order for their=
 proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the "pr=
oportionate reduction" requested.=20

We need to get Paul Cherry working on the credit of MGI Supply ASAP.

s intention to move forward with this LOI with an agreed upon rate (even th=
ough it currently says "To Be determined") prior to execution.  I will keep=

 any of these issues, please feel free to contact me, otherwise, please loo=
k forward to review our next draft prior to us sending it back to Pemex.

Thanks,=20
