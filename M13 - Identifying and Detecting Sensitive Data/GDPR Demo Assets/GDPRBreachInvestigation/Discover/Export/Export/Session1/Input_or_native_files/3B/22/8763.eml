I have made the following changes to the Capital Charge template:

Added Dr/Cr sign clarification to all 3 lines calculating Total Capital
Changed the Increase/(Decrease) in Cash Required line to reflect the proper=
 signs - it was backwards in the previous template; in other words, a cash =
inflow would reduce the cash required
Under Adjustments, removed third party interest income, as this is included=
 in IBIT
In note (C) related to the Net Intercompany Balance, removed lines 0901, 09=
15, 0936, and 0941, as these are already included in note (A) as part of Hy=
perion line TOT_SHARE-EQU; removed line 0218 and replaced it with TOT_INV_C=
ONSUB
Changed note (D) to clarify that when referring to monthly cash usage (as o=
pposed to beginning capital balance), lines 0901, 0915, 0936, and 0941 shou=
ld be included
Amended note (E) by removing lines 1615, 1679, 1750, 1719, 1710, 1722, 1755=
, and 1725 and replaced them with TOT_INT_EXP_OTH

Thanks,
Steve

Subject:	Capital Charge and Revised Plan Templates

Attached are the templates for calculating the Capital Charge and the revis=
ed format file for resubmission of the Plan.  Within the Capital Charge fil=
e, I have listed the applicable Hyperion lines for certain line items in th=
e schedule.  Please let me know if I have missed anything. =20

With regard to the revised format file for Plan, the most notable change in=
 the format file is that the Financing Costs section has been deleted, as p=
reviously discussed.  Also, note that any changes that have been made to th=
e Plan for quarterly IBIT targets should be included in this iteration, but=
 only if you have previously communicated those changes to me.

Additionally, in previous emails on this subject, we had stated that the Re=
vised Plan would be due on February 24th. We have noted that this is a Satu=
rday, so the due date will be Monday, February 26th by  2:00pm.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Steve
