<br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal
<br>
<br>I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity. &nbsp;I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.
<br>
<br>The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month. &nbsp;A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.
<br>
<br>Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:
<br>
<br>2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
<br>2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31
<br>
<br>I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.
<br>
<br>Thanks for your help on this.
