Have we talked to Jan Johnson about this any more? &nbsp;I need to know the scope and estimated expense before we move ahead. &nbsp;I would still like to talk to Jan. &nbsp;I will give her a call next week.
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>Tracy,
<br>
<br>As you know Project Sunrise no longer has within its scope the development of a process for bi-directional data flow between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse, at a level sufficient for ETS. &nbsp;Because of this the EST IT group is now exploring solutions that will achieve what is needed. &nbsp;Considering we thought this was being worked on by Sunrise, until a few weeks ago, we have a great deal more work ahead of us than earlier expected.
<br>
<br>In Operations we will need Hoang Vo working on our project until the end of April 2002 at a minimum. &nbsp;He is currently scheduled to roll of the project at the end of January. &nbsp;We need to get with Adaytum and reserve this additional time. &nbsp;Do you want to do that or would you rather to go ahead and work with Fred Ali to make the arrangements.
<br>
<br>Thanks, Lee
<br>
