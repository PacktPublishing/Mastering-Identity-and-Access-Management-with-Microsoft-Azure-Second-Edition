Rod - What is our policy of accepting direct charges for corporate assistan=
ce?   Should this remain in corporate and be a part of the allocation?

Mike - Was any agreement made up front with Brindle to cover Kyle's expense=
s?   Was the request to travel made by Dave Odneal or yourself?

Morris, can you look at this for us.  I kinda think that the Corp Allocatio=
n is the right place for this expense.
