I will have Mary check into this when she gets back on Thursday. &nbsp;I believe it should be part of the allocation.

<br>Does this cost center get allocated or direct charged? &nbsp;Please get back to Morris for me.

<br>Rod - What is our policy of accepting direct charges for corporate assistance? &nbsp;&nbsp;Should this remain in corporate and be a part of the allocation?
<br>
<br>Mike - Was any agreement made up front with Brindle to cover Kyle's expenses? &nbsp;&nbsp;Was the request to travel made by Dave Odneal or yourself?

<br>Morris, can you look at this for us. &nbsp;I kinda think that the Corp Allocation is the right place for this expense.

<br>I appreciate Kyle's expertise and work, but do we always pay the direct expenses for Corp assistance? &nbsp;

<br>Kyle Norosky who works in Enron Corp Business Controls, recently flew to Minneapolis with regard to security issues. &nbsp;He has told me that his trip is to be charged to ETS/Northern Pipeline cost center or project code.
<br>
<br>Please can you let me know what company number and code to charge this to. &nbsp;The total cost of his trip was $1603.28
<br>
<br>Many thanks.
