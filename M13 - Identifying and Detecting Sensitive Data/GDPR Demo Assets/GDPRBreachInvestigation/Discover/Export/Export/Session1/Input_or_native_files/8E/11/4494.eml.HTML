After much delay the capital charge was recorded in CS last night. &nbsp;Attached is a file with the calculation. There should be a sheet for each business unit. Significant changes were made by some buiness units on Monday and Tuesday, so we are reviewing the timing of the capital charge. &nbsp;If you have any questions, please contact either me or Steve Schwarzbach.
