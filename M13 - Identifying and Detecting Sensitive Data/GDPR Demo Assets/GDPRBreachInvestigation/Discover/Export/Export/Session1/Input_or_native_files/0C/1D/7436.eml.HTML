My concern is that what we are discussing would require the expenditure of funds of an extra $500K this year in order to move about $700 K of income to next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what event in 2002 will allow us to create the income. &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe based upon the contract, that the event has already taken place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone can explain to me how this makes sense, I would like to hear it. &nbsp;

<br>to my knowledge...we kept the &quot;status quo&quot; for sept (third qt)...that is, it &quot;grew&quot; by another $100,000.
<br>
<br>from an acctg perspective we do have some flexibility to set the reserve at a level deemed appropriate

<br>I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002. &nbsp;The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns. &nbsp;If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Would you confirm that this is still our decision? &nbsp;If so, we will include the earnings upside &nbsp;in our Quarter Forecast next week.
<br>
<br>Thanks
