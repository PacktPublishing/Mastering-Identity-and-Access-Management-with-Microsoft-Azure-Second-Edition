<br>Thank you. &nbsp;Stan and Rod are looking to me to coordinate all these new companies we picked up. &nbsp;Its easier to track if it all comes through one place.

<br>
<br>Okay.
<br>
<br>I didn't send Mark anything new as the number I gave him came from our 2nd CE with adjustments for the things transferred in and out of EGAS. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Agatha and I will coordinate with you in the future.

<br>Please make sure your numbers go through me or Stan before we give them to Corp. Corp's request for these things should be coming through me in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;Rod and I are meeting with Stan on Monday, October 22. &nbsp;We would like to discuss your 4th Q numbers then if possible.
<br>
<br>Let me know.
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>
<br>Mark,
<br>
<br>In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE. &nbsp;It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE &nbsp;( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East. &nbsp;&nbsp;This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr. &nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.
