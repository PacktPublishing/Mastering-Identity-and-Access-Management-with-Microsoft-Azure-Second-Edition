<br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November Operational Storage Purchases
<br>
<br>Stan,
<br>
<br>In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers. &nbsp;In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date. &nbsp;Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:
<br>
<br>Ending October Balance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12 Bcf
<br>Ending November Balance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13 Bcf
<br>Ending December Balance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Bcf
<br>
<br>To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month). &nbsp;We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf. &nbsp;We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level. &nbsp;Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.
<br>
