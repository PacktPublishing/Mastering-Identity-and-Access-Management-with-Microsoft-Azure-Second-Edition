MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas=
 Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Septembe=
r 28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the =
tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and =
the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001. =
 In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate durin=
g the Global Settlement. =20

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course=
 of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement. =20

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on t=
he commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.   =20

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Trans=
western failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has=
 created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafte=
r of the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the com=
plaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a =
six-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation=
 factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward=
 for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Tr=
answestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  According=
ly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore p=
ossible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you ha=
ve any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me=
 at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.
