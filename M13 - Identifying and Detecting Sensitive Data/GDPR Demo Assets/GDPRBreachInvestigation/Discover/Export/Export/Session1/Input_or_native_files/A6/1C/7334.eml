	Dawn,
	In the files you have sent for the 2002 Corp. Costs you have a column for =
ETS HQ.  It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that o=
ne column.  We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these oth=
er companies.  For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co.=
 1195, these need to be separated out in detail.  Both Co. 1202 and Co. 119=
5 have employees.  Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the d=
ollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spre=
adsheet.  Thank you for your assistance.  Should you have any questions ple=
ase call.
	Mary
