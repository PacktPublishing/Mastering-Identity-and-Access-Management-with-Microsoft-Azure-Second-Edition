The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom. &nbsp;All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo. &nbsp;If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge. &nbsp;We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.
<br>
<br>Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
<br>If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at &lt;http://home.enron/employeemeeting&gt;. &nbsp;Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.
<br>
<br>Video Teleconferencing
<br>The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago. &nbsp;If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.
