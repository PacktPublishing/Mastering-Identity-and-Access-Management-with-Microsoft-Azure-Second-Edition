<br>Subject:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FW: Set up FAR orders for EPSC billing
<br>
<br>Please see Debra Thompson's note below regarding not setting up FAR orders for floor space billing. I also received a message from Billie Akhave stating EPSC will not be billing to FAR orders -- only company/cost centers.
<br>
<br>The last information I had was that all pipeline company employees' space should be billed to FAR orders. Has this changed?
<br>
<br>Thanks for your help.

<br>
<br>Maria - Please speak with Dave if you haven't already. &nbsp;It will not be necessary for you to set these FAR orders up at this time. &nbsp;I left a message with Tracy Geaccone to communicate this to Ruthann Frausto.

<br>Maria, &nbsp;See the attached. &nbsp;I believe you will set up the co. 0062 and 0085 FAR orders.
<br>
<br>Miriam, I believe you will set up the co. 1195 FAR orders but you need to check with Silvia first. &nbsp;I think you will also set up the co. 0584 FAR orders but check with Barney first.
<br>
<br>Ruthann,
<br>Although there are people in the co. 0584 cost centers right now, they are in the process of being moved to other pipeline companies by 01/01/2002. &nbsp;There will be no employees on co. 0584 after the first of the year.
<br>
<br>Thanks to all,
<br>Pat

<br>
<br>We have been instructed to begin charging all floor space and related charges to FAR orders for all pipeline employees. I was advised that the FAR orders to be used should be xxxx20009999, which is &quot;G&amp;A Custom Variant - Asset Not Specific&quot;.
<br>
<br>I've looked up all xxxx20009999 FAR orders in SAP and determined which cost centers for Houston employees need to have this FAR order set up. Attached is a spreadsheet showing the FAR orders which need to be created.
<br>
<br>Please call me if you need any additional information, and let me know when the FAR orders are created.
<br>
<br>Thanks for your help.
