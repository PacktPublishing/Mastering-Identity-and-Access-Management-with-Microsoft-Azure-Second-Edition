<br>
<br> I met with Rod this morning and he reviewed and revised the category of the capital projects. &nbsp;Please see attached spreadsheet for the new information. &nbsp;Once again I will let you determine how you want to present the number on the capital form so you can account for rounding for the different projects. &nbsp;Sorry this is even later but I am working as fast as I am able. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>I am preparing booklets with the capital project write ups for each functional area and will have them to you today. 
<br>
<br>Steve I will work with you on how you want to handle. &nbsp;&nbsp;
