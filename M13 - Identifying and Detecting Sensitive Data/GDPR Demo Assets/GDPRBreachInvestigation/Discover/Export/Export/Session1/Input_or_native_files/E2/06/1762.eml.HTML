<br>Subject: Emissions Strategy Meeting....
<br>
<br>PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR AVAILABILITY!
<br>
<br>The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an &quot;Emissions Strategy 
<br>Meeting&quot; in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate 
<br>change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the 
<br>potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.
<br>
<br>The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
<br>information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
<br>worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
<br>policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
<br>for Enron in both the short and long term. &nbsp;We invite you or a member of your 
<br>group to participate in this important strategic discussion.
<br>
<br>Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 12 
<br>p.m.). &nbsp;Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can 
<br>finalize our arrangements.
<br>
<br>Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda. &nbsp;If you have 
<br>any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to 
<br>contact me of Jeff Keeler.
<br>
<br>We look forward to your participation.
<br>
<br>
