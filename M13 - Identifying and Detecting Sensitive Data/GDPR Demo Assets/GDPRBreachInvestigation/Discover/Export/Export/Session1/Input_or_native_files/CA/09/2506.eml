Here are the answers to questions 1, 2, & 4:

1.  What percent of TW's volumes transported during the 3rd Qtr 2000 and 3r=
d Qtr 2001 was firm
     vs. interruptible?


		   	       	            2000 			            2001
  				July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
IT Percentage			.09	.09	.09	 	.10	.08	.07
Firm Percentage		.91	.91	.91		.90	.92	.93


2.  What percent of TW's pipe capacity was used during  3rd Qtr 2000 and 3r=
d Qtr 2001?=20
=20
		   			2000 			            2001
West flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.90	.95	.97 	 	 100	 100	 .91


		   			2000 			            2001
East flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.81	.85	.86	 	 100	 100	 .91

4.    On James Weitekamp's "ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights=
" schedule, transport=20
      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st=
 Qtr 2001.  This doesn't=20
      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is n=
ot.  Why does this difference
      exist?
=20
     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarte=
r volumes flowing=20
     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increase=
d from East to East because=20
     pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter.
