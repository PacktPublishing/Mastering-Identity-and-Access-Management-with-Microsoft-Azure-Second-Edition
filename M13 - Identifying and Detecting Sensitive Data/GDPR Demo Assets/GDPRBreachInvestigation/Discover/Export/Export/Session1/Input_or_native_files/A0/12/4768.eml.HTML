You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right now. &nbsp;&nbsp;Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing projects I will call them directly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this company. &nbsp;Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS group it was consolidated within. &nbsp;Probably the Services Group, but maybe Corp. &nbsp;Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting can look into the actual intercompany allocations if any. &nbsp;Tracy, can you do me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and I'll try to give you a call later this week. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Tracy, I may be able to locate the 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am &nbsp;not comfortable that we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999. &nbsp;In addition, the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)
<br>
<br>Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited financials for EGP Fuels Company. &nbsp;Included with these financials are footnote 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disclosures. &nbsp;Please provide the following information to be included with these financials.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) &nbsp;Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for 1998, 1999, and 2000. &nbsp;(I would think that the books of EGP should show the actual charges. &nbsp;Our reserve records only provide a total distribution allocation. &nbsp;This will have to come from accounting.)
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) &nbsp;EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 2000. &nbsp;(As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level. &nbsp;The best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available. I'll need to speak with AA&amp;CO directly to determine best course of action.)
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) &nbsp;EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for benefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 1998,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1999, and 2000. &nbsp;(Same as above.)

<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cynthia,
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation that I would still receive some type of response, even if that response was merely that 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the information is not available. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, it was suggested that I try contacting You, Mikie and Sandy for this information but I did not receive a response from 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any of you without additional proding. &nbsp;And, those responses left me believing that I would hear more from you, which I did not. &nbsp;Lastly, I did mention that if
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary we could look at using Financial Accounting for this information but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and less 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accurate information. &nbsp;Also, Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is not the preferred method of providing this information. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Accounting is my only recourse and that You will assist in convincing Arthur Andersen
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requirements.
<br>

<br>
<br>Sandy told me she talked with you last week in the elevator lobby. &nbsp;Just so you know I am not ignoring you I have literally worked 4 weeks straight without a day off and with an average of 14 hour days! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete. &nbsp;If you need it immediately, then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you about last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting. &nbsp;There is no way I can look at this until later this week.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy,
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Andersen has requested benefits information necessary to complete audited financials that are required to complete Project Timber (the sale
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the MTBE assets to EOTT). &nbsp;The following requests have not been acknowledged and remain unanswered. &nbsp;Please let me know who I should contact
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this information. 
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arthur Andersen has since also requested this information for the 6 months ending June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001. &nbsp;Any guidance you can provide is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatly appreciated.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X54899
