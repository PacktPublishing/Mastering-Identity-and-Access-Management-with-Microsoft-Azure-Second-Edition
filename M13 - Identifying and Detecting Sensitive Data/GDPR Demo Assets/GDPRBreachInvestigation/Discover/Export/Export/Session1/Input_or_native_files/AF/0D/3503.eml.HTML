fyi
<br>This &quot;banked&quot; gas can't be recovered. It's Koch's gas now and they purchase 
<br>from Devon at reduced price....

<br>Victor,
<br>
<br>I wanted to keep you in the loop of an issue on Gulf South. &nbsp;I watch these 
<br>wellheads very closely and still have managed to accumulate penalty gas on 
<br>meter 2848 for May. &nbsp;I spoke with Victor Haley to alert him as soon as I 
<br>discovered this issue and he was looking into it. &nbsp;The wellhead is flowing 
<br>nearly twice as much as normal. &nbsp;Victor H. was checking to see if another 
<br>wellhead has been added at that point. &nbsp;He still does not have any further 
<br>information on that meter. &nbsp;He is aware of it, does not seem to be too 
<br>concerned, and has a copy of the spreadsheet attached. &nbsp;You will see his 
<br>original nom request as 2400 and I moved it up accordingly. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Let me know if you want to discuss this any further.
<br>
<br>Thanks!
<br>
