Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requ=
ests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 20=
02 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for =
the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 200=
2 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the=
 inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the r=
oll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.  =20

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and =
the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommendin=
g for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or con=
cerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.
