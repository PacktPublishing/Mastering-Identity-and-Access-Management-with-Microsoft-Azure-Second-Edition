Subject:	Segments

As you know we are looking into new segments for Enron's reporting. Part of=
 this exercise will be to look at adding to our disclosure in order to sati=
sfy the=20
investment community and help them better understand Enron's business. One =
of the possible items of disclosure is net income on a segment basis. This=
=20
would involve the allocation of debt and therefore interest to the segments=
 similar to what we do for ROE and capital charge calculations. Because thi=
s=20
could be reported we are taking a harder look at these allocations as we wi=
ll need to be able to defend externally.=20

Although we will not be segmenting based on business units I would like to =
look at capital structures at the business unit level. This of course will =
be aggregated=20
up to the appropriate segment as they are determined. I am currently focusi=
ng on an estimated 12/31/2001 balance sheet for allocation purposes. This i=
s our best=20
guess at what would report at year end. We are using the 7/31/2001 actual b=
alance sheet as a starting point and rolling based on the 2nd current estim=
ate turned in
by the business units and adding in any estimated transactions to occur  be=
tween now and year end.

I would like to set up meetings with each business unit to discuss their th=
eoretical capital structure and get your ideas sometime EARLY the week of S=
ept 17.
We will try to make a first pass based on each business units ability to se=
rvice debt and reasonable credit ratios based on comparables. Please take t=
ime=20
to think about this and give me a call to arrange a time to meet. Thanks.
