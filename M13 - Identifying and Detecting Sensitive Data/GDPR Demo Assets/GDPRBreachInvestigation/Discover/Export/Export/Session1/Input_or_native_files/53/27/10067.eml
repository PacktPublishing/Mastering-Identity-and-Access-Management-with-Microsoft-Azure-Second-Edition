Only the Ad Val and Tax Compliance groups intend to charge clean fuels.  If=
 Methanol is the only thing left and it is Corporate, then the charges woul=
d stay on the Corp. tax cost centers instead of being charged to ETS.  Than=
ks for your information.  This will not change your 2002 allocations since =
I had not included the Clean Fuels charges.

Clean Fuels was comprised of three companies.  The MTBE plant and the Mt Be=
lvieu storage and grid were sold to EOTT this year.  Enron kept the Methano=
l and has shut it down.  I guess I need to understand exactly what they are=
 doing for which company.  The Methanol plant actually rolls up to Corp and=
 other, so allocating costs to them will be a hit to Corp.

Tracy,

We have several cost centers in Tax that wish to allocate to Clean Fuels.  =
How do you want us to handle these assuming that they should not go to EOTT=
?

Dawn:  Only assets were sold to EOTT.  The legal entities still remain with=
 Enron.  The $30,000 cost represents clean fuel companies and Methnol.

Greek,=20

Our understanding is that Clean Fuels has been sold to EOTT and so I includ=
ed the Clean Fuels allocation in with EOTT's number.

Dawn:  Laura Mattox of EOTT called inquiring about her tax charge(CC14502) =
of $79,000 which is 3 times more than last year.  My records show a charge =
of $49,000 to EOTT.  Can you help me explain the $30,000 difference?

Thanks,=20
