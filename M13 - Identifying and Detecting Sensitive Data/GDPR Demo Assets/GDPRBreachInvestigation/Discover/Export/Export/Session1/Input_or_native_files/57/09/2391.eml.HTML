I believe in 2001 it was $5.5. &nbsp;Clean Fuels and HPL received some in 2001 and not any in 2002.

<br>
<br>Our budget for SAP was $700,000 for 2001. &nbsp;Has it really gone up that much ($6,000,000 divided by four is $1,500,000)?

<br>
<br>The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum. &nbsp;We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct. &nbsp;The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes. &nbsp;Mary will change all but NBP. &nbsp;Cheryl please make change for NBP. &nbsp;This is per Rod's instructions. &nbsp;When we get the user list we will revise.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks
