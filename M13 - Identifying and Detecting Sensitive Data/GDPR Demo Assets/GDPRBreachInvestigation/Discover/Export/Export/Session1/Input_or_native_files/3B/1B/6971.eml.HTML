Please review and verify the attached spreadsheet. Make any corrections to employee info in RED on the spreadsheet
<br>
<br>As we will not hold a pre-ranking meeting, please provide a pre-rank of 1-5 (see attached rating descriptors) for each employee. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>COMMERCIAL:
<br>Commercial employees are identified by a C in the Peer Group column
<br>You should be prepared to represent these employees at the July 9 Commercial PRC meeting
<br>
<br>
<br>COMMERCIAL SUPPORT:
<br>
<br>Commercial Support employees are identified by a CS in the Peer Group column
<br>You should be prepared to represent these employees at the June 21 Commercial Support PRC meeting
<br>Non-exempt employees (Clerks/Adminstrative Assistants/Coordinators) will not participate in a PRC meeting. &nbsp;Your ranking on the spreadsheet 1-3 (see attached rating descriptors under Job &nbsp;Group Participation) will be the final ranking for these employees
<br>
<br>Note: If your employees used the PEP system to do a self-evaluation, it is important that you review the accomplishments section of the self-eval prior to attending a PRC meeting. &nbsp;This information will be available to display on the screen during the meeting. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>If you have any questions, call me at 5-3847. &nbsp;Please send the completed spreadsheet to me no later than MONDAY, JUNE 11.
