Legal is requesting some information for the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing r=
elated to the merger by the end of the day tomorrow.  Please see below.  I =
have listed the description of the codes below.  The information is request=
ed for the year 2000.  Please provide a list of states in which Enron subsi=
diaries (entities incorporated in the U.S. only) which earned revenues in 2=
000 (1) have customers, (2) conduct their operations, or (3) have physical =
office locations (as specified below) for the following NAICS codes only.  =
The revenues should include intercompany revenues.

I am attaching a file which was compiled a few months ago, containing the l=
argest Enron companies earning revenues in 2000 and their respective NAICS =
codes.  This is not all-inclusive, but is a good start.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
