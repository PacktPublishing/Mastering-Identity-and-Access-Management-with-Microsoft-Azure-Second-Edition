Attached is a file that Cheryl and I developed concerning the Corporate MMF and Direct Charges budget that we have received to date. &nbsp;We have to send out a partnership budget on Monday, October 1 and would like to get a good handle on which of these charges will be eliminated or reduced substantially at the Friday meeting. &nbsp;Since we are unsure of the benefit that many of these charges provide to us, it is doubtful that the partnership would approve all of these increases so we don't want to send out a budget that has them in it. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>It is our understanding that you want our questions directed to your group so that you can address corporate planning yourselves. &nbsp;Please let us know if you need any additional clarification about our questions. &nbsp;
<br>
