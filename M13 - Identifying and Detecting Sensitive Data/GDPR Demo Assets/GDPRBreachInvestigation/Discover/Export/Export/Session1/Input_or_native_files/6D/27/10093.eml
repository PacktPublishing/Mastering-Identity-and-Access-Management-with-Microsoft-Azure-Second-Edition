We don't report this info separate.  I am afraid it will lead to alot more =
questions.   I would prefer system average.

Thanks

Tracy:

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Quest=
ion 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for cap=
acity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for ca=
pacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's bu=
siness is the West market. =20
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages =
should stand alone and not be=20
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the offi=
ce.
