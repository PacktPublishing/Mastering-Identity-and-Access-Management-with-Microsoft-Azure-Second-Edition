After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still be=
ing amortized in 2002.  We need to take that out of your numbers.  Jim and =
Kiri thought it was approximately $14 million.  Thus, PGG should have an IB=
IT of $270.  Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzb=
ach thanks.

Hi Tracy,

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorr=
ow
morning.  This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not
previously budgeted.  It also has a more detail break-out of capital
expenditures.

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-ou=
t
for our cost as you have requested.  Our GL is build on FERC accounts and i=
s
not condusive to SAP type sorting.

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year=
.=20
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late
November.  There will be significant swing between quarters from these resu=
lts
to the final one.

Let me know if you have any questions.
