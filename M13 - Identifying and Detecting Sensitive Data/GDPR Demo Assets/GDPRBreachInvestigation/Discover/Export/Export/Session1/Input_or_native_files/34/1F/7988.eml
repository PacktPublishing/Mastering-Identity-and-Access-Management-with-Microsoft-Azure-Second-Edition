I had a meeting with Dan Pribble and Barney Brasher this morning reviewing =
the current status of the TW Operation forecast.  It appears, at this point=
 in time, that we have been able to clear up and cover all the unplanned ex=
penditures, except for a remaining stretch of approximately $1,000,000.   W=
e are working with all entities within ETS Operations on NNG and TW to find=
 ways and means to cover this remaining stretch between the two companies (=
TW) and (NNG) during the month of December.

Since late October, Barney and his team have uncovered expenses on TW in th=
e amount of approximately $3 million that was not covered in the Fourth Qua=
rter forecast.   We have cleaned up all but the remaining $1 million.

Dan and Barney have both held meetings face to face with the parties involv=
ed in forecasting, or lack of it, and are implementing corrective actions.

We really appreciate the massive effort all personnel are taking to help al=
leviate this situation and we within OSS have implemented tighter controls =
and reviews on all the Business Units.   We will initiate weekly flash revi=
ews and monitor closely the processing of all expense invoices during the m=
onth of December.  If you have any futher insights of means to relieve this=
 situation, please advise.

Morris
