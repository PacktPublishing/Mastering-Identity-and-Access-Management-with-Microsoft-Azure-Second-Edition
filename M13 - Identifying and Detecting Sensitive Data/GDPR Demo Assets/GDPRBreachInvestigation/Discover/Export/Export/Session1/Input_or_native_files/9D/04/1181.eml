You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right n=
ow.   Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing=
 projects I will call them directly.   =20

Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I =
do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this c=
ompany.  Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS gr=
oup it was consolidated within.  Probably the Services Group, but maybe Cor=
p.  Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting ca=
n look into the actual intercompany allocations if any.  Tracy, can you do =
me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and=
 I'll try to give you a call later this week.   (Tracy, I may be able to lo=
cate the 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am  not comfort=
able that we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999.  In =
addition, the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)

Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited =
financials for EGP Fuels Company.  Included with these financials are footn=
ote=20
	disclosures.  Please provide the following information to be included with=
 these financials.

	1)  Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for=
 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (I would think that the books of EGP should show th=
e actual charges.  Our reserve records only provide a total distribution al=
location.  This will have to come from accounting.)

	2)  EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 200=
0.  (As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level.  The best we can do =
here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this wi=
ll likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not=
 have available. I'll need to speak with AA&CO directly to determine best c=
ourse of action.)

	3)  EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for be=
nefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs f=
or 1998,
	     1999, and 2000.  (Same as above.)

	Cynthia,

	Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation =
that I would still receive some type of response, even if that response was=

	the information is not available.   Also, it was suggested that I try cont=

	any of you without additional proding.  And, those responses left me belie=

on that if

 but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and =
less=20
	accurate information.  Also, Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is no=
t the preferred method of providing this information. =20

	Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Accoun=

	that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requireme=

Sandy told me she talked with you last week in the elevator lobby.  Just so=
 you know I am not ignoring you I have literally worked 4 weeks straight wi=
thout a day off and with an average of 14 hour days! =20

I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete.  If yo=
u need it immediately, then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you =
about last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting.  There is no =
way I can look at this until later this week.

	Cindy,

	Arthur Andersen has requested benefits information necessary to complete a=
udited financials that are required to complete Project Timber (the sale
	of the MTBE assets to EOTT).  The following requests have not been acknowl=
edged and remain unanswered.  Please let me know who I should contact
	for this information.=20

	Arthur Andersen has since also requested this information for the 6 months=
 ending June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001.  Any guidance you can provide is
	greatly appreciated.

	Thanks,
