Due to some problems with my email yesterday, I may not have received your 
<br>RSVP.....please excuse any confusion this may have caused.
<br>
<br>
<br>RSVP REQUESTED!
<br>
<br>The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an &quot;Emissions Strategy 
<br>Meeting&quot; on Friday, May 18 to discuss global emissions issues -- such as air 
<br>quality regulation, climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and 
<br>explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial 
<br>groups.
<br>
<br>WHEN: &nbsp;Friday, May 18
<br>TIME: &nbsp;&nbsp;10:00 am - 3:00 pm - lunch will be provided
<br>WHERE: &nbsp;Enron Building, 8C1 (8th floor)
<br>
<br>A video conference is being organized to enable broad participation from the 
<br>London office and a teleconference will be set up for others who would like 
<br>to call in.
<br>
<br>The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
<br>information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
<br>worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
<br>policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
<br>for Enron in both the short and long term. &nbsp;We invite you or a member of your 
<br>group to participate in this important strategic discussion.
<br>
<br>Please RSVP as soon as possible and let us know if you plan to participate in 
<br>person, via teleconference or via video conference from the London office.
<br>
<br>An agenda is forthcoming. &nbsp;If you have any questions or suggestions in 
<br>advance of the meeting, please do not hesitate to contact me or Jeff Keeler.
<br>
<br>We look forward to your participation.
