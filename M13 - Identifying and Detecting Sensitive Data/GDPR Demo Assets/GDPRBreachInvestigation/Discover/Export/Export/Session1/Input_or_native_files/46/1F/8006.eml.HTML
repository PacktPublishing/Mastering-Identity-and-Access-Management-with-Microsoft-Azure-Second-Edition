<br>Importance:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High
<br>
<br>Please find below the agenda for the 2002 Plan Review with Stan on Friday, October 12 in 49C2.
<br>
<br>Danny has requested that the following people attend from his group: Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Dave Neubauer, Eric Gadd, Rob Kilmer, Mary Kay Miller, Shelley Corman, Joe Hartsoe and Kent Miller. &nbsp;Please bring anyone else you think is appropriate. &nbsp;You should plan on attending from 10:00-1:00.
<br>
<br>Rod has requested that Jerry Peters, Jim Saunders, Steve Gilbert and John Keiser attend. &nbsp;John and Steve need to sit in on their respective commercial group and may sit in on the other pipelines as well.
<br>
<br>Stan's other direct reports are not required to attend. &nbsp;We will primarily discuss the commercial groups' 2002 strategy.
<br>
<br>I will need a headcount for breakfast and lunch. &nbsp;Please let Kathy Campos know if you are attending, what time you will be there for and your location (Houston or Omaha) by the end of the day today.
