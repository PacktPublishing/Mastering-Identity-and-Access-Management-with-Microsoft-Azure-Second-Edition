Attached are the latest revised Corporate Assessments for 2002.  There have=
 been some minor changes but the major update is to the Click at Home progr=
am.  Remember that the Click at Home program assesses actual dollars so the=
 numbers included in the spreadsheet are estimates for planning purposes.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
