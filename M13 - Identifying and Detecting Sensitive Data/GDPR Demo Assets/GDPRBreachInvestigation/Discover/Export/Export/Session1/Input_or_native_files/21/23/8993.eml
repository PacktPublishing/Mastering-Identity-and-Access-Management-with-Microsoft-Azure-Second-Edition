Subject:	FW: Activity Rates for 2002

The ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates were set at t=
he time of the SAP go live, in July 2000.  With the labor true-up process i=
n place it really does not matter what the standard rates are; at month end=
 the standard rate used when someone exception codes, is trued-up to actual=
.  During the month you can have a variance before the true-up takes place.=
  From an O&M standpoint ETS does not utilize the real time reporting featu=
re of SAP due to our cost allocation model.  IF Project Systems is being ut=
ilized to manage real-time project costs, during the month, a variance will=
 always exist prior to true up.  Routine rate review and maintenance will l=
imit the variance.

My recommendation is that if adjustments are made they should be coordinate=
d at the ETS consolidated level.  At the time of the SAP implementation All=
ison Milan conducted a study across the different companies and Accounting =
set the rates with the participation of HR.  Since going live with SAP the =
integrity of the ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates =
and their application to all cost centers has not been maintained because t=
here is not central control point for this process.

Theoretically they should now be off by the merit increase in 2001.  Each y=
ear at merit time would be the logical time to make adjustments to the rate=
s.  An option would be to wait until 2002 merit time and make adjustments b=
ased on 2001 and 2002 merit results.  It would also be a good time to synch=
ronize all of the ETS "F" cost centers with the same rates.

If I can provide any additional help, please let me know.  Thanks.

All,

This is to inform you that the activity rates have been copied from Decembe=
r 2001 to all periods in 2002.  Please validate for your business unit and =
notify me with any issues.  If you need to make adjustments to the rates yo=
u may also proceed with that process.

These rates need to be validated prior to Jan 1 to ensure a smooth transiti=
on.  Please respond back to this email when complete.

Thanks, Paul

All,


This is a follow-up to the email sent several weeks ago concerning activity=
 rate planning for 2002. =20

I have begun the process of copying the existing rates planned for December=
 of 2001 to all periods in 2002.   I am currently thru period 5, 2002 and e=
xpect to be complete with period 6, 2002 by late today.

Requested actions:

1.  After we are complete it will be the responsibility of each business un=
it to go in and confirm data and nofity me of any issues.  I expect to be c=
omplete by Wednesday of next week which will give you at least a month to r=
eview.

2.  Also, please notify me if there are any additional changes to the prima=
ry and secondary contact list for your business unit.  I have made the chan=
ges that I have received at this point and the current distribution reflect=
s those changes.



Look for a note from me next week that signals completion of the data copy.=
  If you would like to begin reviewing data thru period 5 please do so.

Thanks, Paul

Call me with any questions at ext 55013.
