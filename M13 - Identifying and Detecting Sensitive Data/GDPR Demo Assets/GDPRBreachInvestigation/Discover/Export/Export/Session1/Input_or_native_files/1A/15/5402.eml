FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for =
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pi=
peline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and=
 a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI.=
=20
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for t=
he failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East pro=
ject will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to =
northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansi=
on consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inc=
h diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western P=
A. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and N=
ew Jersey.=20
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be i=
n service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepres=
s.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary sai=
d Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Wil=
liams Energy Marketing are all customers.=20
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection =
with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 =
million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station.=20
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generat=
ing Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would=
 cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.=20
