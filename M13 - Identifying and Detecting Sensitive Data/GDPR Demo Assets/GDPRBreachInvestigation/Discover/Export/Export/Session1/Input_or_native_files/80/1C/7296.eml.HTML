<br>yes, I have seen the fertilizer companies back off their buying due to gas 
<br>prices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terra Resources reduced their purchasing signficantly for the 
<br>month of June, supposedly they bought no spot gas at all only term 
<br>commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;There total load is around 200,000 but I do not know the mix 
<br>up between spot and term. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also CF Industries and Farmland (which are small 
<br>gas buyers) reduced their volumes as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PCS initially reduced their 
<br>voumes for thier Geismer facility but when gas prices dipped to upper 3.90s 
<br>and low 4.00's they came in and bought the supples they had curtailed and are 
<br>at max volumes.
<br>
<br>
<br>Thanks.
