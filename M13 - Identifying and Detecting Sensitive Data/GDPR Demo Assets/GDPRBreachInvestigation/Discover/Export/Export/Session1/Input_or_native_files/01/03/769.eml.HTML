Tracy and James,
<br>
<br>Elaine and Phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in the plan review package for Stan's review next week.
<br>
<br> 
<br>I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002. &nbsp;Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not heard that from Stan. &nbsp;The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM net contribution. &nbsp;The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG. &nbsp;42P does not have employees and they use NNG employees. &nbsp;When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P. &nbsp;Therefore, &nbsp;42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise. &nbsp;Phil feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG. &nbsp;James and I talked about this on the phone.
<br>
<br>Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
<br>
<br>Thanks!
<br>Rositza
