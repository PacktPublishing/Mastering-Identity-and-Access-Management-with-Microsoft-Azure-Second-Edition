I thought they only supported the six Houston people.

I know for a fact, that the California is self contained.  I believe that E=
urope is the same way.

Does networks really support all of these people?  If assets are sold, I as=
sume support would go away?

Thanks

Tracy,

The file we received from Corporate listed an estimated 461 domestic employ=
ees and 526 international (987 total) for the 2002 plan.  This information =
came from the Corporate headcount request to the BU's that was due on 6/22.=
  Currently there's a group of 937 (451 domestic, 486 international) that i=
s being supported.  I'll call you tomorrow to see why there's such a large =
discrepancy between this headcount and the 6 you're projecting.

Listed below are services the Infrastructure group provides to EREC:

IT Security, Policy, Monitoring, and Investigation
Software License Management
Terminal Server Operations
DMZ Security
24x7 Support

passthrough services:
Calling Card
Video Conferencing
Remote Access

Mike, is this a FOR SURE thing?  What about timing?  Of the announcement as=
 well as closing?  If we build our allocations on things that may happen, w=
e will be changing it daily.  I think we must assume status quo until it's =
final.

Allison,
Just spoke with Tracy.  The plan for EREC is to sell approx 85% of the equi=
ty to a 3rd party in 2001.  Once sale is complete, the EREC Houston personn=
el will not be relying on Infrastructure services.  Please communicate this=
 to the appropriate Infrastructure assessment groups.  I'd like to have rea=
dy before the final BU assessments go out this week. =20
Thanks,
Mike
