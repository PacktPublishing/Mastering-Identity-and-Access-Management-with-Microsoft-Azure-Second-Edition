Scott, I would like to sue Kim in an expanded role within the group. She will 
<br>still be responsible for all of her current activities but will also work 
<br>with the group on Pipeline postings and expansions, RFP and information 
<br>responses, Development of Presentations, etc. &nbsp;I think that in the long run 
<br>she can develop and be moved into other positions. &nbsp;Especially after she 
<br>earns her degree. &nbsp;I have spoken with HR. &nbsp;We will monitor to assure that she 
<br>does not let any of her curent responsibilities slide. &nbsp;Let me know if you 
<br>have and concerns.
<br>
<br>
<br>Also, I have completed the Performance plan for John Hodge ( Required due to 
<br>his ranking in 2000). &nbsp;I will leave a copy on your desk for review and 
<br>execution. &nbsp;Let me know if you have any questions.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Frank
