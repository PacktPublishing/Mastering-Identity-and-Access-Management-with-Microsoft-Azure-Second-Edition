Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter=
 close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that t=
his is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in co=
njunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman=
 has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, =
with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopef=
uly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summar=
y of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months e=
nded August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the mos=
t often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits=
, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some=
 categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the map=
ping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first=
 sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, =
various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide a=
n explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format y=
ou choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please t=
ake your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We ha=
ve provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you ne=
ed to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to u=
sing the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU s=
hould have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies =
to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder=
 of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating ex=
penses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet i=
n the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the tot=
als sheet (Total Year Estimate). =20

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this t=
ime of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive =
project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and underst=
and that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910=
.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this W=
ednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve
