<br> 
<br>David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function. &nbsp;The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman. &nbsp;Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
