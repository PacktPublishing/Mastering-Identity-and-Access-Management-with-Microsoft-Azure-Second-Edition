In delaying implementation until COB Wednesday, I was trying to get past AG=
A's announcements.  I've been told that they may not be able to liquidate i=
mmediately after AGA's are released.  (If market collapses, then buying sho=
rts would be easy, however if market rallies, the impression is that they m=
ay want to sell into the rally.)

The short version is that they like their positions.

Immediate desk head feedback has been to delay these factors, perhaps imple=
menting over the weekend.

Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  Val=
ue-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  Sho=
rts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical ri=
