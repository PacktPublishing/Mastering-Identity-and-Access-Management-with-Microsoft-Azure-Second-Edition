<br>Re: &nbsp;DTI Changes Effective 11/1/01
<br>
<br>On September 21, 2001, Dominion Transmission, Inc. (DTI) 
<br>filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP01-632 in order 
<br>to implement its Settlement which was approved by the 
<br>Commission in a letter order issued September 13, 2001. &nbsp;DTI 
<br>anticipates an effective date of November 1, 2001. &nbsp;Included 
<br>in DTI's filing are revised rates under its Rate Schedule 
<br>GSS which Transco uses to render service to its customers 
<br>under its Rate Schedules LSS and GSS. If accepted as 
<br>proposed, the revised DTI rates would result in the 
<br>following changes to Transco's current Rate Schedules LSS 
<br>and GSS rates:
<br> 
<br>GSS Deliverability Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0006 increase 
<br>GSS Injection Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0171 decrease 
<br>GSS Withdrawal Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0171 decrease 
<br>GSS Excess Delivery Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0170 decrease
<br>LSS Demand Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0007 increase
<br>LSS Injection Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0193 decrease
<br>LSS Withdrawal Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0194 decrease
<br>
<br>In addition, on September 21, 2001, DTI filed revised tariff 
<br>sheets in Docket No. RP01-611 in order to comply with the 
<br>Stipulation and Agreement in Docket Nos. RP97-406, et al. &nbsp;
<br>The filing reflects a phased conversion of Rate Schedule 
<br>GSS-II entitlements to Rate Schedule GSS with a proposed 
<br>effective date of November 1, 2001. Included in DTI's filing 
<br>are revised rates under its Rate Schedule GSS which Transco 
<br>uses to render service to its customers under its Rate 
<br>Schedules LSS and GSS. If accepted as proposed, the revised 
<br>DTI rates would result in the following changes to Transco's 
<br>current Rate Schedules LSS and GSS rates: 
<br>
<br>GSS Deliverability Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0100 increase 
<br>GSS Capacity Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0002 increase

<br>GSS Excess Delivery Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0043 increase
<br>LSS Demand Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0120 increase

<br>LSS Injection Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0001 decrease
<br>
<br>On September 28, 2001, DTI also filed revised tariff sheets 
<br>in Docket No. RP01-625 in order to update its Electric Power 
<br>Cost Adjustment. &nbsp;Included in DTI's filing are revised rates 
<br>under its Rate Schedule GSS which Transco uses to render 
<br>service to its customers under its Rate Schedules LSS and 
<br>GSS. If accepted as proposed, the revised DTI rates would 
<br>result in the following changes in Transco's current Rate 
<br>Schedules LSS and GSS rates effective November 1, 2001: 
<br>
<br>GSS Deliverability Charge - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$0.0023 increase
