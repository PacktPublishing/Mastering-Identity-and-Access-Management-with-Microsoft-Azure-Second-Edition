Attached is a revised version of the capital charge presentation.  Several =
clarifications have been made based on issues raised by various business un=
its. One of the more significate is that Cummulative Translation Adjustment=
 will be excluded from Equity.=20

Cash flow will now include the change in all intercompany balance sheet acc=
ount - Hyperion lines 0051, 0052, 0037, 0038, 0218, 0486, 0516, 0517, 0660,=
 0661, 0878, 0901, 0915, 0936 and 0941.  This should simplify the cash flow=
 when cash transfers are made between companies and when intercompany divid=
ends and contributions are made.

Steve Schwarzbach is working on the template to calculate the capital charg=
e for the restated plan.  He will be sending this out on Tuesday.  I have a=
dded a slide with the Hyperion lines that I think are need in calculating t=
he Total Capital.  Please let me know if I have missed anything.

Please let me know if you have any questions, issues, etc. =20
