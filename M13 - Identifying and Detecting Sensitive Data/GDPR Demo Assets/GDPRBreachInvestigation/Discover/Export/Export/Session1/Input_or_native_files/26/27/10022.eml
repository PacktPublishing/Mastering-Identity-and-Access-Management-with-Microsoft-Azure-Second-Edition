Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things=
 look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new envir=
onment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the com=
ing weeks.=20

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concer=
ning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and te=
lephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye stra=
in and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additiona=
lly, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk;=
 this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller=
 ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors. =
 While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specif=
ic unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio =
to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equi=
pment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya =
telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Pa=
ge 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stento=
phon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:

Channel	Avaya	Stentophon=09
Weather Channel	12401	801=09
CNN Headlines News	12402	802=09

CNN	12408	808=09
Fox Sports	12409	809=09
ESPN1	12410	810=09


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the flo=
or, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing =
a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality ser=
vice for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move. =20

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is be=
ing tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to =
keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help =
with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes w=
ith Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is test=
ing additional software products to provide some of the features not availa=
ble with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys,=
 external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they beco=
me available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration =
to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, q=
ueries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com
