Victor,

I wanted to keep you in the loop of an issue on Gulf South.  I watch these=
=20
wellheads very closely and still have managed to accumulate penalty gas on=
=20
meter 2848 for May.  I spoke with Victor Haley to alert him as soon as I=20
discovered this issue and he was looking into it.  The wellhead is flowing=
=20
nearly twice as much as normal.  Victor H. was checking to see if another=20
wellhead has been added at that point.  He still does not have any further=
=20
information on that meter.  He is aware of it, does not seem to be too=20
concerned, and has a copy of the spreadsheet attached.  You will see his=20
original nom request as 2400 and I moved it up accordingly. =20

Let me know if you want to discuss this any further.

Thanks!
