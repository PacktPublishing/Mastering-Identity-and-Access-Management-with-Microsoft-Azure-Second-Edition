Fair Value is applied to plant and is being amortized over a useful life.=20
TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess o=
ver book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the tim=
e of the  acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an appli=
ed to plant. Goodwill is meant to be a "leftover" after all costs have been=
 allocated.=20

Banks want to exclude goodwill. How would you explain the difference betwee=
n the two?
