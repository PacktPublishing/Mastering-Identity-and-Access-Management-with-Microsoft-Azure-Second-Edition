Tracy,
<br>
<br>I have reconciled the detail file on these and no other ETS company is picking up the costs. &nbsp;I will be sending a detailed list of the companies to receive restricted stock with the final allocations on Wednesday.
<br>

<br>These companies have 200-300 people on them each, I hope no other ETS company is picking up their share! &nbsp;Please let me know.
<br>
<br>Thanks

<br>Elaine,
<br>This is the response we received from Corp. on allocations to 1202 and 1195.
<br>
<br>
<br>Mary, 
<br>
<br>Other than possibly benefit items, we won't allocate to those companies individually. &nbsp;I am getting a copy of the Restricted stock allocations and they may have some charges to these companies. &nbsp;I suspect that any charges to these two are in the ETS-HQ line but will work with Sharon Aulds to confirm. &nbsp;

<br>
<br>Check with Dawn on these companies. &nbsp;If they don't have employees, the probably won't have Corp Charges.

<br>
<br>None of my companies (1202, 42P, 1195, 184) are listed in this spreadsheet. &nbsp;What do I need to include in my Function? &nbsp;Are you going to send me a portion of the ETS HQ? &nbsp;It may make more sense to take those straight to the pipelines rather that flow them through 1202. &nbsp;Please let me know what you want to do.
<br>
<br>Thanks, &nbsp;Elaine

<br>
<br>Attached is the revised Corporate Allocation worksheet. &nbsp;Corporate cost center budgets will be reviewed with senior management on Tuesday, Sept. 11. &nbsp;We do not expect significant changes to the allocations, and any additional changes will be communicated to you for inclusion in your business unit's plan.
<br>
<br>Please let me know if you have any questions.
<br>
