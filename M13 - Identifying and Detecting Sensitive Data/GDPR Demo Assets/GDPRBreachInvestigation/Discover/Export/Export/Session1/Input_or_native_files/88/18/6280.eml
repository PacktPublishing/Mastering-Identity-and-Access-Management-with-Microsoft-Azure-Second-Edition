Tracy,

I'm sure you have no time for this now, but I wanted to get this informatio=
n to you as soon as I had it.  I am very concerned to learn that only a par=
t (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of=
 Steve Kean's budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to=
 EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understand=
ing that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group. =20

Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of a=
pproximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 =
budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we w=
ere able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget (=
$470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a tota=
l of $1,888,000. =20

I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not=
 allocated to EGS entities.  Do you think this can be accommodated or shoul=
d we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan?  (=
I have not broached this with Stan.)  I've attached spreadsheets with my co=
rp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget.  When you have time, I would appre=
ciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.

Thanks,

John

or 2002?

Thanks

Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the bus=
iness.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and wi=
ll let you know. =20

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my gro=
up's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI,=
 I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's gr=
oup and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS bud=
get.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Ple=
ase let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John
