After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still be=
ing
amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach
thanks.=20

Hi Tracy,=20

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorr=

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-ou=

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year=

ts=20

Let me know if you have any questions.
