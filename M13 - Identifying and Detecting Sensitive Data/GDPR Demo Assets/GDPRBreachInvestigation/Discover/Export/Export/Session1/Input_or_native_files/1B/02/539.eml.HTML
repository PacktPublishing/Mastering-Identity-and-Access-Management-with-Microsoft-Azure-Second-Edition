How does this look?
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet. &nbsp;I changed it to be consistent with the other &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capacities (which include ROFR capacity).
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR. &nbsp;These contracts were then dropped after 2005. &nbsp;I continued the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extensions through 2006.
<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.
