Mary - Regarding the 100883 and 1000222, Mike Terraso will be meeting with Mr. Horton tomorrow.  Regarding 140196, I've attached below the description of the group.  Additionally, John Brindle, the cost center owner, mentioned that both Mr. Horton and Phil Lowry are aware of the group's activities and costs.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Regards, 
Elizabeth

	Elizabeth,
	In the Corp. allocations there are 410,000 dollars budgeted to ETS for cc 100883.  Mr. Horton has an agreement that none of the costs from this cc shall be assessed to any of the pipes in ETS.  Please have these costs removed from your allocation to ETS.  Thank you.

	Also, can you provide me some information regarding the costs for cc 100222, Gov't Affairs Environment and cc 140196, Business Controls.  We are meeting with Mr. Horton next week and would like to provide him some explanation of the work that makes up these costs.  If you could respond by Tuesday, Oct. 9, that would be very helpful.  Thank you.
	Mary
