Do you want us to include the peanuts and workable lavatory?

Kidding aside.
The trip normally takes 3.7hrs round trip depending on winds/weather etc. 3.7*$4,800=$17,760.
Of course a corporate aircraft can never be compared to commercial travel on cost alone. There is no comparison. It is all in the safety, confidentiality, time effectiveness, customer contact and support, flexibility of routing and scheduling, being free from distractions and interruptions, less stress on executives and retention of key employees. Depending on who is on board, when you weigh the cost of unproductive time using the airlines vs. conducting business with your whole group during a trip you will see the cost expenditure, when you need it,  is invaluable.

Caroline,  What I been told is the following:

	$3,775/hr  fixed costs plus variable costs associated with specific trips i.e. fuel, landing fees, catering etc.

Typically I think an average per hour cost of $4,500 is used.

Gary,  Does this sound reasonable for budgeting purposes?

Dana

For the 2002 Plan NNG will budget aviation by function i.e commercial, operations etc.  Therefore each functional area needs to assess their company plane usage and budget accordingly for 2002.

Gary,  Once we have rolled each functional area up to the NNG legal entity level we will be able to provide you with the total NNG aviation budget for 2002.
