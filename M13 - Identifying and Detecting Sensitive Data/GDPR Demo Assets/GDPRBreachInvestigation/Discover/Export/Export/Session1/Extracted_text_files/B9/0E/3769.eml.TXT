This is calculated using, form the NBP 2000 10-K:
Net income+ minority interest in net income + interest expense, net - equity AFUDC.

	$196.0 million

This is not a number we generally use.  We always include EBITDA in our press releases.  Just FYI, EBITDA for 2000 was $259.0 million and, in addition to the above, is adjusted by depreciation and amortization and goodwill amortization
