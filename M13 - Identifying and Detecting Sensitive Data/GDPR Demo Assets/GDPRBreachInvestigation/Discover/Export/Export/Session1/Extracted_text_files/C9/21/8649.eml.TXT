Forward to FL distribution list.

Note:  The Florida legislative session ends May 4.  It is highly unlikely 
that any action will be taken on wholesale electric deregulation this 
session. 

I spoke to a staff member of the House Utility and Telecommunication 
Committee yesterday and she informed me that they are starting the process 
for an interim legislative study to expand on the interim report prepared by 
the 2020 Study Commission (specifically the "stranded benefits" issue).
