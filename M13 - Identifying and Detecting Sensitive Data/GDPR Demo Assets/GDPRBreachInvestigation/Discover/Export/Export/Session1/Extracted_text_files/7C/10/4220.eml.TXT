Where do we need to go for EREC?  It is better to fly commercial over and then take the Enron plane around when we get there?  Is this date ok with Adam?

Good morning, Tracy!   

Stan wants us to look at the week of May 6, 2002, to travel to Europe and meet with Colin's team(s) and Adam's team(s).   See if we can hit all the necessary sites within that one week time span.

I'll await to hear back from you.

Thanks!
