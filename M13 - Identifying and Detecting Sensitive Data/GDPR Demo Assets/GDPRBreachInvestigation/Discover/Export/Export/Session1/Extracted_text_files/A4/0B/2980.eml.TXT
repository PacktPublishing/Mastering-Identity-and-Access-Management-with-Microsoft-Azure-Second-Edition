No problem, we will have them to you by 2pm.   Also, I am still working on 
getting this info to you in a more systematic manner but our IT people 
are currently swamped.

Subject: Important bidweek information




Scott,
  Please let your gas traders know that Inside FERC will not accept bidweek
prices via fax any later than 2 p.m. Eastern time. It takes a great deal of 
time
to input each deal by hand and then re-check the data for accuracy -- and 
that's
before we even begin to analyze each pricing point to determine the indexes.
  If anyone has any questions, they can contact me at the number below.
Regards,
Liane Kucher, Associate Editor
