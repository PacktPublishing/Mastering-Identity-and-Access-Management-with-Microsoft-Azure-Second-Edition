Subject: 3rd Current Estimate

Attached are the files for the PGG 3rd current estimate. Please take a look at the comments and footnotes. We are assuming the goodwill transfer to ENA as of 7/1, and have given them the amortization to include in their forecast. Let me know if you have any questions.
