Subject: RE: Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN 74-1294795 (Account	 L80-30571)

Tracy, I talked to the Colorado Sales and Use Tax auditor today.  The auditor will submit two assessments:  Assets and Compressor Fuel.  

Compressor fuel will be assessed, but I believe the following are plausible arguments that might succeed and favorably adjust the estimated $350,000 liability (Plus Penalty & Interest):

	(2)(b)(ii)  "Purchase Price" should be adjusted to reflect TWP as a market maker, that could purchase natural gas 			lower than market could supply and transportation in San Juan Index
			(Price should be $1.80 / MMBTU down from Avg $1.90/ MMBTU)
	   (b)(iii)	The correct tax rate would be 3%, not 5%, local tax should not be applicable.  Formal research is required.


Assuming $1.80/MMBTU, the original estimate ($350k) might be adjusted down to $231,218.46, or as low as $138,731.08, as follows:

				 2,569,094 	Consumption  MMBTU
			   $		1.80 	Price / MMBTU
			   $4,624,369.20 	Purchase 
				$92,487.38 	Local Tax
			     $138,731.08 	State Tax
			     $231,218.46 	Total Tax

Please call if you would like to meet and discuss this issue.

Tracy, I called the auditor last week, following our conversation.  The auditor has not returned my call.  Field work is complete and no formal assessment has been issued.  I have unresolved issues which the auditor must consider before issuing the assessment. In Summarizing our conversation last week:

1)  I have not seen a preliminary assessment, which I hoped would be coming in October.
2)  During the auditor's field audit, the auditor proposed to assess tax on the following issues:
    a)  Assets Purchase $500,000 in Tax, Penalty & Interest.  I might protest almost all assessed 
	  amounts for this category.
    b)  Expenses (Compressor Fuel) Estimate $350,000 for audit Period.  Issues not resolved:
	  i)    My position is that no tax is due, except for domestic fuel consumption.
	  ii)   If "Compressor Fuel" is taxable, what is the "Purchase Price".
	  iii)  Is the 2% local tax applicable to "Compressor Fuel"?
	  iv)   Should tax be calculated prospectively, rather than retroactively?
	  v)    If assessed, Transwestern requests that the current regulation be revised to 
		  reflect a change for this issue (Tariff may accommodate a pass through without
		  a rate case?).

I will provide a copy of the assessment for your records and subsequent consideration, when available.  The auditor was promoted during my audit and is transition.  Considering this transition and my challenges, response time is unpredictable.

Could you please give the Transwestern Business Unit Coordinator some advice on when this audit will be resolved and what you think the best estimate is on the amount of compressor fuel tax  (PPI) that have to expense.

Thanks

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?
The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 
The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  
If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.  He isn't Dan's boss, but they're in the same CC and only a couple of cubes away in the Jefferson bldg.   
I don't think we have any reserves/accruals for these on the TW balance sheet.

Has Jerry Moore from the tax group been involved in this?  Do I have anything on the balance sheet for this?

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of "Compressor Fuel" consumed in a "continuing business activity" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,
Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.
