I have Rod's staff meeting, but I can miss it if that is the only time you have available.

Danny:
I was visiting with Tracy this morning about the NNG/TW Actual meeting scheduled for Wednesday, December 12th at 2:30 (note follows Stan's Half Staff meeting).  
Tracy inquired what material you want to cover.  Please consider and I will set up a meeting for you and Tracy to discuss in more detail.
Thanks.  

Tracy, I have Friday AM open.  Please advise.
