Rod and Tracy:

Jerry Peters would like to meet with you on Thursday, October 11, upon his arrival in Houston.  Jerry is scheduled to land in Houston at 2:39 pm, so he suggested scheduling a meeting at 4:00 p.m.  Topic of discussion is Northern Border SAP Charges for 2001.

Please let me know if you would be available to meet with Jerry at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, October 11.

Thank you.

Dee
