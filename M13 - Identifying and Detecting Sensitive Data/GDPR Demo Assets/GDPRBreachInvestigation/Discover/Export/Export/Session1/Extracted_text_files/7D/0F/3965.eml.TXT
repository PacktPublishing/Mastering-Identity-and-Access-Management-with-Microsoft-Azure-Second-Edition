Tracy,

As discussed, the EEOS functions, including NEPCO, previously turned in to Corp are defined as follows:


Commercial  -  Includes Engineering, Project Management, Construction Management and Business Development.

Logistics  -  Includes Procurement.

Other Mid-Office  -  Includes Project Controls, Estimating, QA, Contracts and Administration.

Legal  -  Includes Legal.

Accounting/Audit/Finance/Treasury  -  Includes Accounting & Finance

Human Resources  -  Includes HR personnel

Executive  -  Includes the Presidents of EEOS & NEPCO and other Nepco Executive staff.

Other  -  Includes Nepco rent and employees for Caxios, Nepco Europe, OEC & EPIC.


Do you need these defined further than this? I did not include the obvious functions Enron Property Services or severance.

Blake
