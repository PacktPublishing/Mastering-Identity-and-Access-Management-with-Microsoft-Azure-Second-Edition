Subject:	2002 Plan Headcount for ENW

One of the drivers for IT Infrastructure's allocation methodology is headcount.  At this time, Enron Net Works would like to verify 2002 plan headcount for your business units.  I have attached the 2002 headcount template that was completed for Corporate back in June.  Please update this template to reflect your latest 2002 headcount information.

The deadline to return this information to me is by the end of the day, Tuesday, October 2nd.  If you have any questions, please call.

Thanks,

Kevin
