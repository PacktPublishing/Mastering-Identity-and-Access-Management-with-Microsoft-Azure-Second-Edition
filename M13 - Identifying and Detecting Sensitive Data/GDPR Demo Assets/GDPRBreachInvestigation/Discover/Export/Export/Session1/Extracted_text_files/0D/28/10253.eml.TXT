Create your profile on cera.com! 

Open your web browser and go to:? http://www20.cera.com/client/newaccount/ 

The first screen you will enter will ask for your COMPANY USERNAME and 
PASSWORD.? 

The Enron Corp. username is:? ? ??????? enron

As you begin to initiate the account creation process, you must create your
