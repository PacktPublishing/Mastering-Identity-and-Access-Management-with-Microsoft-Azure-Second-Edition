 << File: trading track rotations.xls >> 

Attached is the current list of rotations for the Trading Track participants and future assigned rotations (as decided at the time of hiring).    Can you please re-confirm you have these people in your group currently, as I appear to have conflicting information.  I will re-send, if any changes occur.

If there is any movement of these people between groups can you plese keep me in the loop.

Kind regards,

Karen.
