Tracy,
 
Only the Ad Val and Tax Compliance groups intend to charge clean fuels.  If Methanol is the only thing left and it is Corporate, then the charges would stay on the Corp. tax cost centers instead of being charged to ETS.  Thanks for your information.  This will not change your 2002 allocations since I had not included the Clean Fuels charges.

Clean Fuels was comprised of three companies.  The MTBE plant and the Mt Belvieu storage and grid were sold to EOTT this year.  Enron kept the Methanol and has shut it down.  I guess I need to understand exactly what they are doing for which company.  The Methanol plant actually rolls up to Corp and other, so allocating costs to them will be a hit to Corp.

Tracy,
 
Any decision on the question of billing Clean Fuels?

Tracy,
 
We have several cost centers in Tax that wish to allocate to Clean Fuels.  How do you want us to handle these assuming that they should not go to EOTT?

Dawn:  Only assets were sold to EOTT.  The legal entities still remain with Enron.  The $30,000 cost represents clean fuel companies and Methnol.

Greek, 

Our understanding is that Clean Fuels has been sold to EOTT and so I included the Clean Fuels allocation in with EOTT's number.

Dawn:  Laura Mattox of EOTT called inquiring about her tax charge(CC14502) of $79,000 which is 3 times more than last year.  My records show a charge of $49,000 to EOTT.  Can you help me explain the $30,000 difference?

Thanks, 
Greek
