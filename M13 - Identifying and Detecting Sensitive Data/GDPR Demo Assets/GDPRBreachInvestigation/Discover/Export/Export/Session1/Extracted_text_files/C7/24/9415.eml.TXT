I have attached a file containing the 2002 Capital Projects In-Service dates for the NNG Commercial Group.  Also, in the file is another copy of the Cash Flow which was part of the total capital package previously provided to James Weitekamp.  If you have any questions, please give me a call (402-398-7142).

Please return your capital plans asap, no later than Thursday, Sept. 13.  I need by month and in-service dates so we can calculate DD & A and AFUDC.

Thanks
