The latest from a discussion with Rod, Mary Kay and Dave N. this morning:


FA&A will carry the depreciation - targets may be adjusted for yr to yr increase

IMP and FAS 106 will  be carried at FA&A ,Potential offsets to yr to yr increases are yet to be  determined.


Thus, the above items will not be put into the NNG Commercial Adaytum model.
