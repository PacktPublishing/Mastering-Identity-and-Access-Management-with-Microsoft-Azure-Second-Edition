Subject: Nov 8 Schedule for Peggy Fowler

Tracy,
Peggy's flight is scheduled to arrive at 12:06 and depart at 6:55.

So depending on how traffic is, it seems like you could schedule her at
2:30-3:00.  Which would give her enough time to get to the meeting and
enough time to catch the plane given rush hour traffic and the increased
check in time at the airport.

Let Mary and I know if this works for you.
