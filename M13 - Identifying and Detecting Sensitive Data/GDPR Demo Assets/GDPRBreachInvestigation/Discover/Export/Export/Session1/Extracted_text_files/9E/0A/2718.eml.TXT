The message related to both EIS and EPSC charges.  I asked Nancy to check into both.   Cvb

I thought she was asking about EIS charges?

Elaine,
I spoke with Pam Daily;  she said that due to all the recent moves & changes, it would probably be December before rent charges hit the cost centers directly, and that there would not be any 2001 true-ups.
Hope this answers your question.
Thanks, 
Nancy
