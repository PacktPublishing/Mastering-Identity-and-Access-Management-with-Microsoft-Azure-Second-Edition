Subject: EREC "PRELIMINARY" 2002 plan assessments from ENW

Attached is the "PRELIMINARY" 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  Note, we have not included IT pass through items such as long distance, market data, WAN, etc. which is controllable at the business unit level and should be budgeted for by your business unit.

Please keep in mind this is "PRELIMINARY" and is subject to change.  The final 2002 plan assessments will be sent out September 14, 2001.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or there is someone else that you would like to be included in this process please reply back to me with this information, and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Kevin
