Subject: weekly forecast to Corp

Tracy,
Attached is the 4th quarter forecast for EGAS.  It is essentially 4Q from 3CE.  This does not include gain/loss on assets sale which right now it would be Greenfield Shipping loss and EcoElectrica gain.  I'll find out the latest for those numbers  .  Please forward this to Steven Schwarzbach if everything looks OK.  Thank you.
