The attached spreadsheet shows the quarterly reclasses between O&M and COGS for Transwestern for the year 2000.  As we discussed, we are very supportive of making this 2000 reclass in order to avoid having to explain large year to year variances caused only by the re-mapping. It will also conform Enron's reporting to TW's stand-alone GAAP reporting for 2000.  Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks for helping us make this happen.
