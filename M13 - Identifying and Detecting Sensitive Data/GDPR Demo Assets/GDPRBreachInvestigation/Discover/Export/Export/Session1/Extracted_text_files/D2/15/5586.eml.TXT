Subject: FW: Sun Devil D R A F T and meeting notice

I won't guarantee I can make it, but I will try.     Here are some thoughts, as we move forward with this deal:

Levelized rates - will require separate rate base, not rolled in, since the base system is not levelized and separate tariff schedules like a FTS-2
	Also we need to see what the GAAP income statments will look like and what the return on equity will really look like if we do this.    It may surprise some of the 	people.    I also think we need to make sure Stan is OK with the potential result if we are going to offer it.

 Attached is the open season and binding bid package for the Sun Devil Pipeline Project.  We will meet in Steve Harris' office on Thurs 8/2 at 10:30am to get a consensous on the pitch strategy.  We should also have a good idea on rates as well.  I hope you can join us.  If not, please get with me later in the day with any questions or concerns.  Our goal is to release this to the media for publication Friday 8/3.
