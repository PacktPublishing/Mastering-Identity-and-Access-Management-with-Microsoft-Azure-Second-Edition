As an Enron employee who is a member of the United Way Young Leaders, please join other young leaders throughout Houston for a celebration on October 10.  The attached invitation provides all the details. With Enron having the second largest campaign in Houston raising a total of $6 million dollars with the corporate match, it would be great if we could have Enron represented in a big way.  The RSVP deadline has been extended to Monday, October 8, so if you pland to attend, please send a response to youngleaders@uwtgc.org or call 713/685-2306.  Thank you and we look forward to seeing you there.
