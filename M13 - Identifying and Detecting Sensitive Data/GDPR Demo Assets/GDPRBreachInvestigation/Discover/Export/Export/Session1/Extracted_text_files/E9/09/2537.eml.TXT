Scott,

Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David 
Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to 
mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the 
interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been 
pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and 
is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need 
me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be 
happy to help.

Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want 
to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought 
is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may 
be tough to get him back.

Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back 
from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

Kim

John/Kim/David

Just called - can come in on Weds 23rd ( reason why he can't come in earlier 
- vacation from 16th to 19th ) . Still interested in talking - simply a 
scheduling issue - don't seem to be any barriers to moving forward.

They have just moved office - hence new number (7139890962)

Does the 23rd work ?

I didn't mention the Scott Neal call.

Neil
