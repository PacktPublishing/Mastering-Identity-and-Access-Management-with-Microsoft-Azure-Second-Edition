In delaying implementation until COB Wednesday, I was trying to get past AGA's announcements.  I've been told that they may not be able to liquidate immediately after AGA's are released.  (If market collapses, then buying shorts would be easy, however if market rallies, the impression is that they may want to sell into the rally.)

The short version is that they like their positions.

Immediate desk head feedback has been to delay these factors, perhaps implementing over the weekend.

Importance:	High

Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical risk.
