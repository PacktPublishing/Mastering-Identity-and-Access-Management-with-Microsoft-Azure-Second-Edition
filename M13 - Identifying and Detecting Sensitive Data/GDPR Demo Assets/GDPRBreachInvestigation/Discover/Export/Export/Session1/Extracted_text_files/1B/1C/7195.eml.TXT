News & Views
No speech or joke can be great unless it finds a receptive audience. 
The same, of course, is true for the products or services that a

Next time someone tells you "it's all relative," be sure to mention

Technical Tools of the Trade
Have you ever watched a stock that seems to bounce around a lot, but 
never really gets anywhere? You've probably found a stock that is 
locked in a so-called trading range. Understanding the relationship 
between support, resistance and trading ranges can help you spot when 
a stock breaks out of the range and starts a new trend.
