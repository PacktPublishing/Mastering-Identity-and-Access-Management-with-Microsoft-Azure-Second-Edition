I don't know if we have the Trailblazer info in house.  Mike McGowan in Omaha would be the only one who might know.  If he does not have it, we wii have to call Trailblazer directly.  I don't know how to get in touch with Mike outside of the office.  Can you wait until MOnday?  If not, I can try information in Omaha.
