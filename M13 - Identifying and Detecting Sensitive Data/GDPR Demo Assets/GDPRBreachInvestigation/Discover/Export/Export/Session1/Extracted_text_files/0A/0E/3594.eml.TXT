Please make sure that the Corp Planning requests come through me, Rod, or Stan before they go to Corp.  We need to make sure that Stan approves the numbers and is not surprised in Executive committee meetings, etc.. 

Thanks 

Tracy

Our 3CE numbers exclude Azurix but include Middle East, Margaux and E Power transferred from Europe.  We assume no gain/loss from disposition of assets.
