She actually left me a voice mail.  Maybe we are talking about two different things?

Could you please forward her email?  Caroline told me it was about rent - EPSC.

I thought she was asking about EIS charges?

Elaine,
I spoke with Pam Daily;  she said that due to all the recent moves & changes, it would probably be December before rent charges hit the cost centers directly, and that there would not be any 2001 true-ups.
Hope this answers your question.
Thanks, 
Nancy
