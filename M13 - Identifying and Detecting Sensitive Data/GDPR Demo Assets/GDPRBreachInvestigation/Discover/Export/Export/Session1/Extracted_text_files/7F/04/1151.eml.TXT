Subject: UPDATE - UH Recruiting Date Change!

UH Team:

I have just been notified that the UH On Campus Recruiting is being rescheduled due to scheduling conflicts with both UH and Enron.  Once we determine the new dates, I'll forward an email to the team.

I apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused and hope that you will be able to participate in the future.

Regards,
Tracey Kozadinos
