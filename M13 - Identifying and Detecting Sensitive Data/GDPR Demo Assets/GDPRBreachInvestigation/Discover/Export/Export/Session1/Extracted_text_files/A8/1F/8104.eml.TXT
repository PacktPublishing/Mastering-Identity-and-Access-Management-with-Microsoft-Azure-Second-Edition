Tracy,

I have reconciled the detail file on these and no other ETS company is picking up the costs.  I will be sending a detailed list of the companies to receive restricted stock with the final allocations on Wednesday.

These companies have 200-300 people on them each, I hope no other ETS company is picking up their share!  Please let me know.

Thanks
Tracy

Elaine,
This is the response we received from Corp. on allocations to 1202 and 1195.


Mary, 

Other than possibly benefit items, we won't allocate to those companies individually.  I am getting a copy of the Restricted stock allocations and they may have some charges to these companies.  I suspect that any charges to these two are in the ETS-HQ line but will work with Sharon Aulds to confirm.

Check with Dawn on these companies.  If they don't have employees, the probably won't have Corp Charges.

None of my companies (1202, 42P, 1195, 184) are listed in this spreadsheet.  What do I need to include in my Function?  Are you going to send me a portion of the ETS HQ?  It may make more sense to take those straight to the pipelines rather that flow them through 1202.  Please let me know what you want to do.

Thanks,  Elaine

Attached is the revised Corporate Allocation worksheet.  Corporate cost center budgets will be reviewed with senior management on Tuesday, Sept. 11.  We do not expect significant changes to the allocations, and any additional changes will be communicated to you for inclusion in your business unit's plan.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
