Subject:	RE: 2002 Plan Lay Presentation Run Through

We are scheduled to have a follow up meeting on the 2002 Plan with Stan on Thursday, Oct. 25 at 3:00.  I am not sure if you will call in for that or if Tod is handling the meeting.  We can go over Lay review ideas again then.  The agenda for November 1 has you at 4:30 Houston time.  Will that work for you?  If not, are you comfortable with Tod doing it.  Just let me know what I can do to help.

Thanks

Tracy

I am in Germany on Nov 1 but will call in.  Let me know what time Stan wants to do the dry run (I will be 7 hours ahead of Houston; it would be best for me if I could call after 8 pm German time).  I know we will only have 20 minutes with Ken per business unit.  After sitting through my presentation to Stan, I would appreciate your recommendations on what we should focus on for EREC.  Thanks. Adam
