Tracy,

10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.

This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the +/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I suggest it be used for this initial analysis.

Thanks,


John

How much additional capacity/volumes will I get?

Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,


John
