Subject: Weekly Information for Steve

Tracy:

Hope you had a great day yesterday!

Below is what I have prepared for Steve.  Audrey will fax this to him.  Let me know if you are OK with everything.  I went ahead and told him about the OBA re-evaluations because it is reflected in the YTD numbers on the Weeklys.
