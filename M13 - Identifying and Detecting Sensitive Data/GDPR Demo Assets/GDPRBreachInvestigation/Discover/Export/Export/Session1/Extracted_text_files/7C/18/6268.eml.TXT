Subject: Updated 2002 Corporate Assessments - Revision #3

Attached are the latest revised Corporate Assessments for 2002.  There have been some minor changes but the major update is to the Click at Home program.  Remember that the Click at Home program assesses actual dollars so the numbers included in the spreadsheet are estimates for planning purposes.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
