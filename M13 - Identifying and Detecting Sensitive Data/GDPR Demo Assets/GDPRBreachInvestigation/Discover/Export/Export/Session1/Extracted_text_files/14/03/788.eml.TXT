Yes.  James Centilli asked me to get this information.  Mark Walton supplied it to Gary Anderson yesterday and Gary forwarded the information to me.

I gave the information to James yesterday afternoon.

Gary Anderson indicated you needed TW fuel numbers for last two years.

Gas Accounting has a data file of compressor useage by compressor by month.

We can provide the information if you let me know who to contact.
