Subject: TW Weekly for November 30, 2001

Tracy:

I did a preliminary Weekly for Steve since he will be on vacation the rest of this week.  I will do another one tomorrow.
Just wanted to give him a look at where we are since we did not do a Weekly last week.
Please review and if it is OK I will give it to Steve.

Thanks!
