Subject: IT 2001 C.E. vs 2002 Plan

James,
For NNG IT, the Capital is up $2.2MM due to new projects and new business.
For NNG & TW, the primary explanations for the net increases in Direct Support are:

	Risk Management moved from Commercial to IT		$.3MM
	SAN 							$.3MM
	O&E Additional Support (staff) and new software		$.8MM
	Amortization - Future Vision Projects			$.3MM	
	EPSC							$.7MM
		Totals to $2.4MM
 
The FA&A ETS Support variance (Measurement) is incorrect on the worksheet:  2001 C.E. is $1.6MM, 2002 Plan is $1.5MM.
I'll get Gas Logistics to you soon.
Thanks,
Nancy
