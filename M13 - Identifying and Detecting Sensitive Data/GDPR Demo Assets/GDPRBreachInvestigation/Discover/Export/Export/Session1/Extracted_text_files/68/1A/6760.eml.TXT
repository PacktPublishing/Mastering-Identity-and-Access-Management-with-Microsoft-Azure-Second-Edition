okey.  I already responded that I could not meet on Friday.  Since we will be out of the office, I will need the extra time.

Rod and Tracy:

Would you be able to meet with Jerry before the Budget Meeting with Mr. Horton?  Jerry said that a breakfast meeting would work for him.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  FYI, Jerry will be staying at the Doubletree Hotel the night before (Oct. 11).

Thank you, both.

Dee

Rod and Tracy:

Jerry Peters would like to meet with you on Thursday, October 11, upon his arrival in Houston.  Jerry is scheduled to land in Houston at 2:39 pm, so he suggested scheduling a meeting at 4:00 p.m.  Topic of discussion is Northern Border SAP Charges for 2001.

Please let me know if you would be available to meet with Jerry at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, October 11.

Thank you.

Dee
