Latest Findings from Meridien:

1. Get Smart: Intelligent Order Routing and the Institutional Investor

Institutional investors, like their individual counterparts, want to get the best possible execution of their order. While some institutional investors have been improving their order management strategies and technology throughout the 1990s, the buy side as a whole is only now realizing that it needs to pay closer attention to how orders are treated to determine the true operating costs of a mutual or pension fund. New technologies are emerging that are helping them educate themselves and trade smarter. One such technology, intelligent order routing, is a direct response to the emergence of more-and more fragmented-marketplaces. Initially embraced by day traders trading via direct access brokers, this technology is now making its way up the food chain. This report looks at various definitions of intelligence in order routing, focusing in particular on institutional investors. At the end of the day, it is not so much about establishing a standard definition of best execution as it is about making sure that the investing firm (or individual) feels that it has sufficient control of the order.


2. Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Dealers in the USA
(Customer Interaction Client Access)

Many financial institutions are devoting considerable attention to figure out how to serve the wealth management needs of individuals. We have noted a growing, almost feverish pitch among a rapidly expanding number of application and platform vendors that claim wealth management and/or investment management as a solution focus. This brief examines the state of the retail investor marketplace in the United States, which represents the most logical view of the investment management opportunity. We conclude with our perspective of life cycle opportunities and technology solution capabilities that financial institutions should consider to remain effective competitors. A related Customer Knowledge research brief, "Analytical CRM: Understanding Customer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business Models" (Vol. 4, Brief 7, June 7, 2001), examines relevant analytical challenges and opportunities.


3. Analytical CRM: Customer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business Models

Retail broker/dealers in the United States face a dilemma: as they strive to excel in the delivery of topnotch investment services, they must find enough retail investors of the right types. Our companion Customer Interaction research brief "Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Dealers in the USA" (Vol. 4, Brief 8, June 7, 2001) defines the retail investor marketplace and the role of customer interaction technology solutions. In this brief, we examine business models and relevant analytical challenges and opportunities.


4. Wireless Payments at the Point of Sales: Expanding POSsibilities
(e-Payments Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=738
Financial institutions face a choice: they can participate in developing new wireless payment technologies, or they can sit on the sidelines as others take the lead. If they don't get involved, they risk disintermediation by entities like telcos that are not hesitating to jump into the driver's seat with wireless. This report examines the present state of wireless technology and the competing standards that are available today. It also looks at mobile telecommunications firms and their motivations to promote wireless payments. The report contains three case studies of wireless payments programs: one a joint bank/telco initiative, one a bank initiative, and one a company initiative.
