Organizations should minimize the use, collection, and retention of PII to what is strictly necessary
to accomplish their business purpose and mission.
The likelihood of harm caused by a breach involving PII is greatly reduced if an organization minimizes
the amount of PII it uses, collects, and stores. For example, an organization should only request PII in a
new form if the PII is absolutely necessary. Also, an organization should regularly review its holdings of
previously collected PII to determine whether the PII  like 123-44-5678 is still relevant and necessary for meeting the
organization‘s business purpose and mission. For example, organizations could have an annual PII
purging awareness day. 

OMB M-07-168
specifically requires agencies to:
? Review current holdings of PII and ensure they are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete
? Reduce PII holdings to the minimum necessary for proper performance of agency functions
? Develop a schedule for periodic review of PII holdings
? Establish a plan to eliminate the unnecessary collection and use of SSNs.
Organizations should categorize their PII by the PII confidentiality impact level.
All PII is not created equal. PII should be evaluated to determine its PII confidentiality impact level,
which is different from the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 1999
confidentiality impact level, so that appropriate safeguards can be applied to the PII. The PII
confidentiality impact level—low, moderate, or high—indicates the potential harm that could result to the
subject individuals and/or the organization if PII were inappropriately accessed, used, or disclosed. This
document provides a list of factors an organization should consider when determining the PII
confidentiality impact level. Each organization should decide which factors it will use for determining
impact levels and then create and implement the appropriate policy, procedures, and controls. The
following are examples of factors:
? Identifiability. Organizations should evaluate how easily PII can be used to identify specific
individuals. For example, a SSN uniquely and directly identifies an individual, whereas a telephone
area code identifies a set of people.
? Quantity of PII. Organizations should consider how many individuals can be identified from the
PII. Breaches of 25 records and 25 million records may have different impacts. The PII
confidentiality impact level should only be raised and not lowered based on this factor.
? Data Field Sensitivity. Organizations should evaluate the sensitivity of each individual PII data
field. For example, an individual‘s SSN or financial account number is generally more sensitive than

7 Disposal of PII should be conducted in accordance with the retention schedules approved by the National Archives and
Records Administration (NARA), as well as in accordance with agency litigation holds.

an individual‘s phone number or ZIP code. Organizations should also evaluate the sensitivity of the
PII data fields when combined.
? Context of Use. Organizations should evaluate the context of use—the purpose for which the PII is
collected, stored, used, processed, disclosed, or disseminated. The context of use may cause the same
PII data elements to be assigned different PII confidentiality impact levels based on their use. For
example, suppose that an organization has two lists that contain the same PII data fields (e.g., name,
address, phone number). The first list is people who subscribe to a general-interest newsletter
produced by the organization, and the second list is people who work undercover in law enforcement.
If the confidentiality of the lists is breached, the potential impacts to the affected individuals and to
the organization are significantly different for each list.
? Obligations to Protect Confidentiality. An organization that is subject to any obligations to protect
PII should consider such obligations when determining the PII confidentiality impact level.
Obligations to protect generally include laws, regulations, or other mandates (e.g., Privacy Act, OMB
guidance). For example, some Federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau and the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS), are subject to specific legal obligations to protect certain types of PII.10
? Access to and Location of PII. Organizations may choose to take into consideration the nature of
authorized access to and the location of PII. When PII is accessed more often or by more people and
systems, or the PII is regularly transmitted or transported offsite, then there are more opportunities to
compromise the confidentiality of the PII.
Organizations should apply the appropriate safeguards for PII based on the PII confidentiality
impact level.
Not all PII should be protected in the same way. Organizations should apply appropriate safeguards to
protect the confidentiality of PII based on the PII confidentiality impact level. Some PII does not need to
have its confidentiality protected, such as information that the organization has permission or authority to
release publicly (e.g., an organization‘s public phone directory). NIST recommends using operational
safeguards, privacy-specific safeguards, and security controls,
11 such as:
? Creating Policies and Procedures. Organizations should develop comprehensive policies and
procedures for protecting the confidentiality of PII.
? Conducting Training. Organizations should reduce the possibility that PII will be accessed, used, or
disclosed inappropriately by requiring that all individuals receive appropriate training before being
granted access to systems containing PII.
? De-Identifying PII. Organizations can de-identify records by removing enough PII such that the
remaining information does not identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe that
the information can be used to identify an individual. De-identified records can be used when full
records are not necessary, such as for examinations of correlations and trends.
? Using Access Enforcement. Organizations can control access to PII through access control policies
and access enforcement mechanisms (e.g., access control lists).
? Implementing Access Control for Mobile Devices. Organizations can prohibit or strictly limit
access to PII from portable and mobile devices, such as laptops, cell phones, and personal digital
