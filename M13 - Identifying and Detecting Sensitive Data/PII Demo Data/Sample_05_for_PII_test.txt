Springfield is meant to represent "anytown, USA" and not be a specific real town,[5] although the producers acknowledge basing the town on various locations[6] including The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's hometown of Portland, Oregon and Mike Scully's hometown, Springfield, Massachusetts.[7] Groening named Springfield after Springfield, Oregon, and also took inspiration from Springfield being the fictitious setting of the series Father Knows Best. He said, "I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do."[8][9] Groening liked Second City Television's use of Melonville, a town with a large cast of recurring characters that serves as a mini-universe for the show, and partially based The Simpsons on it.[10]

Location[edit]
Because of the many contradictory statements regarding Springfield, it is impossible for the town to exist in a specific state. For example, in The Simpsons Movie, Ned Flanders tells Bart that Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky all border Springfield's state.[11]

The city's unknown and unknowable geography is a recurring joke in the series; despite the "riddle wrapped in an enigma that is Springfield's location",[12] Lisa Simpson states that "it's a bit of a mystery, yes. But if you look at the clues, you can figure it out."[13] Episodes frequently make fun of the fact that Springfield's state is unidentifiable by adding further conflicting descriptions, obscuring onscreen map representations, and interrupting conversational references.

David Silverman, who directed the movie and various episodes of the series, joked that Springfield is located in the fictional state of "North Takoma".[14][15] This is substantiated by the state abbreviations NT and TA used within the show.[15][16] The telephone area codes for Springfield are 636 (St. Charles County and Western St. Louis County, Missouri)[17] and 939 (Puerto Rico).

To promote The Simpsons Movie, various factual towns and cities across the United States called Springfield competed to hold the premiere.[18] The town of Springfield, Vermont, was chosen.[19][20]

The town[edit]
Springfield was founded in 1796 by a group led by Jebediah Springfield (also known as Hans Sprungfeld) that, after misinterpreting a passage in the Bible, left Maryland trying to find "New Sodom."[21] After he refused to found a town where men were free to marry their cousins, half of the group left. The dissenters founded Shelbyville, after fellow pioneer Shelbyville Manhattan, and the two cities remain rivals.[22] Springfield reached its pinnacle in the mid-20th century, when it became the home of the world's first Aquacar factory; one half of the U.S. was said to wear Springfield galoshes and Springfield's streets were literally paved with gold.[23] The town's prosperity faded; a Time cover story on Springfield was titled "America's Worst City",[24] and Newsweek called the town "America's Crud Bucket".[25]
